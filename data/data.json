As flawed as I am, I love literature with all of my heart. The books that I've read and loved have become a part of who I am, a part of myself which I nurture and cherish. Something that cannot be taken from me.\n\nMy first time in jail, I was terrified. I was 25 years old, in a new state, and doing 30 days. Jail is cruel and dehumanizing but most of all it's boring. It was such a relief to find that my county jail actually had a decent little library! I read at least one novel, sometimes two, every single day I was in that jail.\n\nIt was there that I discovered Gene Wolf's *Book of the New Sun*, now a favorite series of mine. I discovered Faulkner and Southern Gothic literature, something that I adore to this day. I read Steinbeck, outside of the scope of what they had us read in school. Reading was just about the only self care I was capable of in that awful place, and despite the best efforts of the criminal justice system, I left that place having been enriched; a more worldly and nuanced person than I was when I went in.\n\nI ended up in jail again last month. At a different jail now, I was disappointed to find that this jail had a far smaller library, mostly John Grisham and Nora Roberts books and very little actual literature. Then I stumbled across a copy of Le Guin's *The Wind's Twelve Quarters*. I very nearly cried when I found it. Le Guin is probably my favorite author, and finding this collection of short stories was like a revelation that I would be ok, I'd survive, I wasn't truly as alone as I thought. After some digging I also found her Earthsea series, which I hadn't read, as I generally don't read much fantasy. Escaping into those books allowed me to escape my circumstances, and again allowed me to nurture that eternal piece of myself. I also had the pleasure of reading what was supposedly the first novel ever written, *The Tale of Genji*. I got to have a little bit of a reading vacation, in a world where you are expected to be crushed and humiliated.\n\nPlease, if you have books you'd like to donate, consider your local jail. The people in those walls are suffering, they are marginalized people, the very people who can be most profoundly impacted by good literature. You may be saving a life, and I guarantee that if you donate even just one good book, you'll definitely be improving one.

Waterstones is an example of how to sell books right from a national chain. Their profits jumped 80% in 2017 and that's because physical book sales in the UK are a growing market again.\n\nThe chain looked much like B&N back in 2011 but was turned around but a new CEO.  His big plan? Decentralised decision making and going back to traditional book selling practices. Here's some key quotes from the rather detailed wiki page:\n\n> In September 2011, the bookseller announced that it intended to drop its 3-for-2 deal on books after a decade in place.[48]\u00a0The offer was replaced with a 'bespoke offer', based on branches choosing their own pricing structures from available discounts.[49]\n\n>2013 saw the start of an overhaul of the company's business strategy, with centralised decision making giving way to store-based decisions and a renewed emphasis on traditional bookselling techniques.[69]\n\n>Waterstones launched a number of new partnerships through the year, including with the\u00a0University of Derby\u00a0to launch a professional qualification programme for its staff,[73]\u00a0with the\u00a0Folio Society\u00a0to extend customer reach and stock selection in London-based bookshops,[74]\u00a0and partnering with a new charity,\u00a0BookTrust.[75]\u00a0\n\n>In a 2016 interview with Daunt, he stated that Amazon \"defines how Waterstones acts\" and while Waterstones could not compete with the internet retailer digitally, it could offer a credible alternative, believing there was \"a future in physical bookselling.\"\u00a0[97]\u00a0Waterstones continued to look at \"fixing the basics\" during 2016, such as adjusting store opening hours and harnessing data from the loyalty card[98]\u00a0as well as refurbishment of physical stores, including the Canterbury branch,[99]\u00a0and work on its e-commerce routes through improvements to product ranking.\n\nEssentially, the company lets individual stores have a huge amount of autonomy for a national chain. This allows them to experiment and work out how best to sell books for their area. What works in one area isn't the optimal for everywhere else. They see their staff's knowledge on books as a critical business asset. Through this empowerment, they have turned the business around from a potential blockbuster to a growing business, both in number of stores and profits.\n\nPhysical books are a growing market again but you need to adjust your business model to innovate and keep on top of trends. This could be a model that B&N could use to avoid being a relic of the past.\n\n"}, {"subreddit": "music", "label": 6, "post": "Prince accused music industry of \"ramming\" Katy Perry and Ed Sheeran \"down our throats\" "}, {"subreddit": "entertainment", "label": 0, "post": "Colin Kaepernick's Nike ad wins Emmy for outstanding commercial "}, {"subreddit": "books", "label": 4, "post": "CNN's Anthony Bourdain dead at 61 "}, {"subreddit": "sports", "label": 8, "post": "I coach youth sports.

I was looking through these recent /r/technology threads:\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/apcmtf/reddit_users_rally_against_chinese_censorship/\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/apgfu6/winnie_the_pooh_takes_over_reddit_due_to_chinese/\n\nAnd it seems that there are a lot (probably most) of people completely clueless about the widespread censorship that already occurs on reddit. And in addition, they somehow think they'll be able to tell when censorship occurs! \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI [wrote about this](https://old.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/apig51/rtheoryofreddit_mods_remove_thread_and_all/) in a few different subs recently, which you can find in my submission history, but here are some main takeaways:\n\n* Over the past 5+ years Reddit has gone from being the best site for extensive information sharing and lengthy discussion, to being one of the most censored sites on the internet, with many subs regularly secretly removing more than 40% of the content. With the Tencent investment it simply seems like censorship is officially a part of Reddit's business model. \n\n* A small amount of random people/mods who \"got there first\" control most of reddit. They are accountable to no one, and everyone is subject to the whims of their often capricious, self-serving, and abusive behavior. \n\n\n* Most of reddit is censored completely secretly. By default there is no notification or reason given when any content is removed. Mod teams have to make an effort to notify users and cite rules. Many/most mods do not bother with this. This can extend to bans as well, which can be done silently via automod configs. Modlogs are private by default and mod teams have to make an effort to make them public. \n\n* Reddit finally released the mod guidelines after years of complaints, but the admins do not enforce them. Many mods publicly boast about this fact. \n\n* The tools to see when censorship happens are ceddit.com, removeddit.com, revddit.com ([more info](https://old.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/apu3oz/with_the_recent_chinese_company_tencent_in_the/eq83p0a/)), and using \"open in new private window\" for all your comments and submissions. You simply replace the \"reddit.com/r/w.e\" in the address to ceddit.com/r/w.e\"\n\n/r/undelete tracks things that were removed from the front page, but most censorship occurs well before a post makes it to the front page. \n\nThere are a number of /r/RedditAlternatives that are trying to address the issues with reddit. \n\nEDIT: Guess I should mention a few notables:\n\n/r/HailCorporateAlt \n\n/r/shills\n\n/r/RedditMinusMods\n\n-\n\n[Those irony icons](https://i.redd.it/c0dbx2p11h121.jpg)...\n\n-\n\nAlso want to give a shoutout and thanks to the /r/technology mods for allowing this conversation.

I had just had a business fail, money was tight as shit, debt to our eyeballs... and I wanted to start again with one of my oldest passions that I'd always been afraid to pursue. So I hunkered down and got into Python, because I remembered liking the language. \n\nI pretty quickly got a job in non-Python web dev (Angular and Node.Js, which I was competent enough in thanks to dabbling) but it was awful. Barely over minimum wage, and despite being very junior I was expected to manage an entire code base and servers and essentially everything techy. So I did the best I could, kept working on my Python projects in my free time, and kept applying to new positions.\n\nEventually a recruiter took a liking to me, and got me some interviews for Python positions. One I totally bombed, but the other two actually ended in two very enthusiastic offers. I ended up being offered more than I'd even asked for, way more than I expected as a Junior. I took the offer and put in my notice at my old job, which ended this past Friday.\n\nI just can't express how excited I am to have this opportunity, the company culture seems amazing, I'll be able to get out of debt, I'll have room to grow and learn and thrive... on one hand I couldn't have done it without reddit communities guiding me (hi, cscareerquestions and learnpython) and on the other hand I'm just so damn proud.\n\nAnyways, I start on the 17th.

So, as an experiment, I moved my Facebook app and put the ebook app in its place.  I normally used the Facebook app when doing things like waiting in the lunch line or at the bus stop or something.  I told myself that from there on out, I would read during those times instead of browsing social media.  The results were more telling than I expected.  Here's what I noticed:\n\n1. I had been checking social media so often that it had become a muscle memory.  For the first few days, I would constantly reach into my pocket, pull out my phone, and open the app, all without realizing.  And then I would be startled to see a sea of words instead of Facebook.  Because I guess reading is something that calls for actual attention, which I wasn't prepared to give during those times.  But I had no idea how habitually I was checking Facebook until I was doing this.\n2. I went to a presentation about criminal justice reform.  When it was getting wrapped up and conclusions were being said, I got bored, and was about to reach for my phone.  But then I thought: if I had a clunky book with me, would I pull it out and start reading it right then?  No, because that would be rude.  Cell phones seem like they're less rude because I COULD be doing something important, like answering an urgent text.  But is being rude OK as long as you're disguising it well?  Hmmm.... \n3. I found myself reading a lot more.  Finishing a lot more books.  Which is great!  Except, it means that I had previously been reading actual books worth of social media on a regular basis.  I find this disturbing to think about.\n4. I came to like ebooks!  They're much easier for reading on-the-go, and since I'm using my library's app I can support the library without having to make the trip down there.\n\nI hope I'm not coming off as some old guy who thinks that phones and social media are evil.  I still use social media regularly, including the apps, but this experiment shed some light on problematic habits I'd formed and how I can use this technology more wisely.

The series itself features a fascinating new plot line related to but not dependent on Harry's adventures at Hogwarts. The protagonist is Harry's son, James Potter, starting at his first year at Hogwarts. The characters are a good mix of characters you know and their descendants, and totally new characters. The conflicts are much more multidimensional, with a lot more moral ambiguity and complexity, without straying from the plucky adventurous tone HP fans will love. The books also delve more fully into the theory and origin of magic, the international wizarding community, the history of magic, and the founding of Hogwarts. The writing style is evocative of JK Rowling without attempting to copy it, with a good mix of humorousness, classes, and childhood antics to complement the main conflicts.\n\nIt's available as an audiobook/podcast by chapter for free, and there are free PDFs of all the books easy to find on Google. Hope you enjoy these books as much as I have!\n\nEDIT: As some people have pointed out, turns out there are actually FIVE books!

The involvement of a police officer does not have any bearing on it at all.

I googled second degree murder premeditation before posting to confirm what I thought and all the links I got told me I was right and that premeditation made the charge first degree.

Whenever I tried to learn these languages or new languages I always was thinking 'I could do this much easier in python.\\` Python is just so nice to work with that it makes me not want to use anything else. And with no need to use anything else that means there is no drive to learn anything else. \n\nMost recently while I was trying to learn go I attempted to make a caeser cipher encoder/decoder. I went about this by using a slice containing the alphabet and then collecting a step. My plan was then to find the index of a letter in the code string in the slice then shift that index accordingly. In python I would simply just use `.index`. But after some research and asking questions I found that go doesn't support generics (currently) and in order to replicate this functionality I would have to use a binary sort on a sorted slice.\n\nPython also does small quality of life things that just come with it being dynamically typed. Like when initializing variables in for loops there is no `i = 0;` etc. On top of all that there is also pip. It is so nice to just `pip install [x]` instead of having to download file then pointing to an executable. Python and pip also allows for pythons to be used for so much. Want to do some web dev? Try django or flask. Interested in AI? How about pytorch.\n\nI guess I'm just trying to say that python is so nice to use as a developer that it makes me not want to use anything else.

Now that things are cooling off, I will make an update thread a few days from now to let everybody know how things have turned out. \n\nThere are also hundreds of people encouraging me to make a YouTube channel and I just wanted to acknowledge that. I really appreciate your interest and may set something up, but I don't have anything at this moment to share.\n\nThanks everybody for their kind words and support. :)\n\nI'm not sure why this thread was locked, I didn't get a message from the mods about it. I assume just because the thread has run its course, and I'm okay with that.\n\n**EDIT 2:**\n\nI had no idea that this thread would blow up in the way that it has -- I only posted here to begin with because a buddy of mine posts here and he said it would be good to share, and maybe get some exposure for the original post. I am pretty overwhelmed with the amount of people who are taking an interest in this and I want to make it abundantly clear that I do not and will not ever support anybody who is dishing out threats and personal attacks against Potates. Be better than that. Thanks.\n\nPotates has DM'd be acknowledging the situation and owning up to it, and does not deserve to be harassed and threatened over this. He has been cool about the whole situation and I am willing to give him the benefit of the doubt, and be cool back. Neither he nor I knew just how crazy this situation was going to get. Again, I am asking you from the bottom of my heart, do not lash out at Potates. Do not harass him, do not harass his family. These actions are 100% wrong and I condemn them wholeheartedly. Calling him out for his behavior is one thing, but when you cross the line into his real life, you have gone too far and need to reexamine your moral compass.\n\n**EDIT 4:**\n\nI am aware that Potates has removed all his videos except for his apology. I am not responsible for this, and I have not filed any kind of DMCA claim against him as we are settling things privately. I have and will continue to encourage him to not delete his YouTube channel, as I believe he can and will bounce back from this controversy. Plagiarism is serious, and there is a lesson here to be learned -- if he respects the content of *all* creators moving forward, then his channel can become a positive part of YouTube again.\n\nIt is easy to be angry at this situation, believe me. But I am always willing to give somebody another chance if they are prepared to make a genuine change, and for now, I am willing to give that chance and let things play out.\n\n-------------------\n\nLink to the Potates video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t26s5aMSBWY\n\nLink to my post, which he reads (mostly) verbatim off in his video without any credit to me, or even that it is a post from reddit, whatsoever: https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/8qsx8s/complete_notes_from_the_noclip_documentary/\n\n\\^That's a massive Fallout 76 info dump based on the Noclip documentary that had a strong community reaction, and got passed around a lot. It took me a while to write up as I watched the documentary, and I spent a non-trivial amount of time making as it clear and concise as possible, using direct quotes whenever possible. Shout out to when he misread one of my points that said camps are saved as blueprints, and accidentally said \"served as blueprints\" which is a nonsensical statement.\n\nI'm passionate about video games, and love to write about them, even though I'm not a professional. So to see something you've written being plagiarized after putting in time and effort to share that written content with people just hurts a little bit. When you're looking for more opportunities to write in a way that will attract attention, seeing somebody else take that attention can really suck.\n\nHe starts his video off at the \"Gameplay\" section of my post, and at the beginning switches up his verbiage a little bit so it's not too obvious. As the video goes on, that stops quickly, and he starts reading every single bullet point almost verbatim. I'm not *too* upset because I'm glad more people got to see the information, but I am a little irritated that he passes it off as his own work. He reads the post like it was his script! Even the way he does the voice over makes it sound as if he is saying these things off the cuff, when in reality he is reading off the words I wrote from a page.  I only found this video at all because I clicked it and wanted to hear new Fallout 76 information -- a minute or two in, I realized that I had heard those words before... because I wrote them!\n\nHere's the thing. If he had shot me a message saying \"hey man, I'd like to quote this post in a video\", I'd have said go for it 100%. If at the beginning of the video he had said something like \"hey guys I found this post on reddit I'd like to read you\", I'd be fine with that. But the fact that he passes this off as if he wrote it all, or as if he took the time to compile this information is definitely frustrating to me. I feel like I put in the work for this, and then this guy turned around and monetized it without even having the decency to acknowledge that it wasn't his. \n\n\n\n\nEDIT: I see a lot of you commenting on the video saying that he has stolen my content. Unfortunately, it appears as if he is deleting all of those comments as they come in.\n\n---------------\n\n\n**EDIT 3:***\n\n~~I tried to comment on Potates' apology video, but the comments aren't going through. Here is what I wrote, if I am able to post it directly on the video I will do so in the morning.~~ **EDIT 5:** It appears as if the apology video has been deleted.\n\n> Hey, I'm _Robbie. First off, I would like to lead with the fact that I completely condemn anybody who is issuing any kind of threats to @Potates and his family. Nobody deserves to be threatened and harassed over a situation like this. \n\n> Secondly, I would encourage @Potates not to delete his YouTube channel. I do not agree that there is no coming back from this. Mistakes were made, feathers were ruffled, and lessons were learned. I have seen smaller YouTube channels come back from worse. I have given Potates full permission to re-post the offending video under the agreement that I am properly credited, and that we can work out our differences in private.

For data science applications, you can open any array or dataframe and scroll through the entire thing, which is quicker and more informative than typing 'data.head()', 'data\\[:10\\]', etc. in a new cell.  Admittedly, opening large dataframes/arrays can be demanding on your RAM, but not any more demanding than opening a large csv file. In any case, if you're still in the data-cleaning phase, you probably don't have any scripts running in the background anyway. \n3. There's no need for extra widgets for visualization, which sometimes cause trouble. \n4. You can make cells in Spyder just as you would with Jupyter: just use '#%%' to start a new cell. \n5.

Expect that update to happen in mid- or late-2020. If you sign up for this Udemy course, you'll get the updated content automatically once I finish it. It won't be a separate course.\n* It's totally fine to start on the first edition and then read the second edition later. I'll be writing a blog post to guide first edition readers to the parts of the second edition they should read.\n* I wrote a blog post to cover [what's new in the second edition](https://inventwithpython.com/blog/2019/10/07/whats-new-in-the-2nd-edition-of-automate-the-boring-stuff-with-python/)\n* **You're not too old to learn to code.

Finally, when we're done with it, we may find - if it's a good novel - that we're a bit different from what we were before we read it, that we have been changed a little, as if by having met a new face, crossed a street we never crossed before. But it's very hard to say just what we learned, how we were changed.\" - Ursula Le Guin\n\n\nIt is from an introduction she wrote for The Left Hand of Darkness which i just started reading, and this quote really resonated with me. I've been reading books since i could read, and my favorite ones are sci-fi.

One, this is my alt account, since I would prefer not to have this post on my main account. Second, even though I\u2019ve been coding for 3 years, I\u2019m not that far ahead. I\u2019ve been moving pretty slowly, and only work on it every Saturday for some amount of time. The rest of my week is spent working on my blog, doing school, with friends, and doing chores.\n\nOk, so now I\u2019ll begin. I\u2019ve been coding for 3 years. I started looking at Reddit about a year and a half ago, just online when I didn\u2019t have an account. Then I made an account, and started learning a ton of this subreddit.\n\nI already have an idea for my career, because if YOU. I can\u2019t believe I actually can do this. I know so many people that are 35 and work at Cookout, so the fact you guys helped me find my dream career just blows my mind. \n\nI\u2019m currently learning Data Science, which plan on learning Machine Learning after. I\u2019ve learned the basics, all the way up to classes and such, as well as search algorithms to create AIs. My most recent one was an AI that solved an 8-Puzzle, using A* Search. Where did I learn about this algorithm? On this subreddit.\n\nNow I\u2019ve never been the best at writing, so I\u2019m running out of ideas in what to say. But I just wanted to let you know that you just made a lost, depressed 13 year old with anxiety, go to a happy, passionate 13 year old with career ahead of him.\n\nThat\u2019s all I have to say, so goodbye :)\n\nEdit: Well now I have another thing to thank you for. For all the support you\u2019ve given me. I thought I would be getting a good amount of hate, but I haven\u2019t seen any so far!

As the title says, college has really killed my ability to read for fun.

EDIT: I am an idiot. I meant Gone Girl. This is what happens when you write posts late at night.\n\nI read the book right before the movie came out and was instantly FLOORED by this monologue, and even highlighted it. So when it was portrayed in the movie so perfectly (in my own opinion, at least), I got goosebumps.\n\nThe cool girl monologue:\n> Men always say that as the defining compliment, don\u2019t they? She\u2019s a cool girl. Being the Cool Girl means I am a hot, brilliant, funny woman who adores football, poker, dirty jokes, and burping, who plays video games, drinks cheap beer, loves threesomes and anal sex, and jams hot dogs and hamburgers into her mouth like she\u2019s hosting the world\u2019s biggest culinary gang bang while somehow maintaining a size 2, because Cool Girls are above all hot. Hot and understanding. Cool Girls never get angry; they only smile in a chagrined, loving manner and let their men do whatever they want. Go ahead, shit on me, I don\u2019t mind, I\u2019m the Cool Girl.\n\n>Men actually think this girl exists. Maybe they\u2019re fooled because so many women are willing to pretend to be this girl. For a long time Cool Girl offended me. I used to see men \u2013 friends, coworkers, strangers \u2013 giddy over these awful pretender women, and I\u2019d want to sit these men down and calmly say: You are not dating a woman, you are dating a woman who has watched too many movies written by socially awkward men who\u2019d like to believe that this kind of woman exists and might kiss them. I\u2019d want to grab the poor guy by his lapels or messenger bag and say: The bitch doesn\u2019t really love chili dogs that much \u2013 no one loves chili dogs that much! And the Cool Girls are even more pathetic: They\u2019re not even pretending to be the woman they want to be, they\u2019re pretending to be the woman a man wants them to be. Oh, and if you\u2019re not a Cool Girl, I beg you not to believe that your man doesn\u2019t want the Cool Girl. It may be a slightly different version \u2013 maybe he\u2019s a vegetarian, so Cool Girl loves seitan and is great with dogs; or maybe he\u2019s a hipster artist, so Cool Girl is a tattooed, bespectacled nerd who loves comics. There are variations to the window dressing, but believe me, he wants Cool Girl, who is basically the girl who likes every fucking thing he likes and doesn\u2019t ever complain. (How do you know you\u2019re not Cool Girl? Because he says things like: \u201cI like strong women.\u201d If he says that to you, he will at some point fuck someone else. Because \u201cI like strong women\u201d is code for \u201cI hate strong women.\u201d)\n\nThis was *the* monologue that made it difficult for me to hate Amy, but also showed the depth of her character and her emotions.\n\nI don\u2019t know if anyone feels the same as I do. I guess this monologue hit me so much because as a woman, there is always a need to be Cool Girl, but there is also always a Cool Girl to hate or be envious of.

It contains the following functionalities:\n\n* **Discover Stocks:** Some features are: Top gainers; Sectors performance; upcoming earnings releases; top high shorted interest stocks; top stocks with low float; top orders on fidelity; and some SPAC websites with news/calendars.\n* **Market Sentiment:** Main features are: Scrolling through Reddit main posts, and most tickers mentions; Extracting trending symbols on stocktwits, or even stocktwit sentiment based on bull/bear flags; Twitter in-depth sentiment prediction using AI; Google mentions over time.\n* **Research Web pages:** List of good pages to do research on a stock, e.g. macroaxis, zacks, macrotrends, ..\n* **Fundamental Analysis:** Read financials from a company from Market Watch, Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, and Financial Modeling Prep API. Since I only rely on free data, I added the information from all of these, so that the user can get it from the source it trusts the most. Also exports management team behind stock, along with their pages on Google, to speed up research process.\n* **Technical Analysis:** The usual technical indicators: sma, rsi, macd, adx, bbands, and more.\n* **Due Diligence:** It has several features that I found to be really useful. Some of them are: Latest news of the company; Analyst prices and ratings; Price target from several analysts plot over time vs stock price; Insider activity, and these timestamps marked on the stock price historical data; Latest SEC fillings; Short interest over time; A check for financial warnings based on Sean Seah book.\n* **Prediction Techniques:** The one I had more fun with. It tries to predict the stock price, from simple models like sma and arima to complex neural network models, like LSTM. The additional capability here is that all of these are easy to configure. Either through command line arguments, or even in form of a configuration file to define your NN.\n* **Reports**: Allows you to run several jobs functionalities and write daily notes on a stock, so that you can assess what you thought about the stock in the past, to perform better decisions.\n* **Comparison Analysis**: Allows you to compare stocks.\n* **On the ROADMAP**: Cryptocurrencies, Portfolio Analysis, Credit Analysis. Feel free to add the features you'd like and we would happily work on it.\n\nNOTE: This project will always remain open-source, and the idea is that it can grow substantially over-time so that more and more people start taking advantage of it.\n\nI hope you find this useful, and even contribute to the project! The installation guidelines are in a much better state now, so it should be much easier to install and play with it.\n\nThanks!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iemlf1kah1n61.png?width=464&format=png&auto=webp&s=33e25d9397c9e5a1c3d90ff786f17dab6f521753"}, {"subreddit": "politics", "label": 7, "post": "Mike Pence mocked for saying liberals want to make \u2018poor people more comfortable\u2019 | Critics online wondered why making the poor comfortable was such a bad thing "}, {"subreddit": "python", "label": 1, "post": "I teach Python courses - here's my collection of about 1,000 slides on various Python topics, including data science (hosted on GitHub, licensed under CC-BY-SA) "}, {"subreddit": "sports", "label": 8, "post": "Drew Brees Announces Retirement from NFL "}, {"subreddit": "sports", "label": 8, "post": "Iranian girl cheers for her favourite football team from behind the fence as Iranian women aren't allowed into stadiums "}, {"subreddit": "travel", "label": 9, "post": "Stuck in Norway for the summer.

First necromancer, sorcerer, wizard, blade singer , etc a similar class exists but is absolutely mauled by MC in the arena.\n15.  Princess falls for farmboy because they would have so much in common.\n\n16.  Hacks the economy: first runes, enchantments , alchemy, invents trains or guns, stumbles on a dead dragon and it\u2019s hoard, marries rich, random mine , transmutes copper to gold , etc. never worried about money again.\n17. If Kung fu then genius . Has a special one fist move or sword technique . Fights are not described in detail mc just punches what ever once and next three paragraphs are others describing how MCis so strong but so young, skinny, looks like girl.\n18. Litrpgs where MC is lvl one and kills lvl 30.\n19. Warriors that everything slows down when they fight . \n20. Any book where a sword cuts thru something like a hot knife thru butter or a scythe thru wheat is trash. \nI could go on .  I miss books where people worked for their skills and supporting characters mattered because the MC would perish without them .  Supporting characters had personalities and yes even occasionally died in battle and as a reader it was devastating. Soft magic is for the lazy writer.  Soft fighting where a warrior cuts down dozens with a sword with no moves described and no chance of loosing.

Lindsey Graham in South Carolina. I\u2019m running for Senate to bring hope back to the working families of SC and to #SendLindseyHome. AMA! Follow us here: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/harrisonjaime) [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/JaimeHarrisonSC) [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/harrisonjaime/)\n\nHey Reddit, thanks for having me! \n\nI grew up in Orangeburg, SC. I was the son of a single mom and learned to read from comic books. My grandparents helped raise me. They didn\u2019t have a lot, but they taught me the important stuff: that hard work and character, matter.\n\nI earned a scholarship to Yale University, and eventually Georgetown Law. I came back to South Carolina to teach 9th grade social studies before I went to work for Congressman Jim Clyburn. During my time in his office, I was the first African-American Executive Director of the House Democratic Caucus and Floor Manager for the House Majority Whip, which Rep. Clyburn became when the Democrats took control of the House in 2006.\n\nI served as the first African-American Chair of the South Carolina Democratic Party before deciding to run for Senate. My most important job, though, is that I\u2019m now raising my two boys with my wife, Marie, in Columbia, SC. \n\nThe American Dream is alive and well for some, but not all Americans. Here in South Carolina, rural hospitals are closing, schools are underfunded, roads are crumbling, and our coasts are threatened by offshore drilling. We need a Senator who\u2019s fighting to improve the lives of South Carolinians rather than focusing on interests in Washington D.C.\n\nI\u2019m running for Senate to fight for opportunity for all South Carolinians. I know that when your community needs help, political party affiliations don\u2019t matter.\n\nAsk me anything about my campaign, how Lindsey Graham has forgotten the people of South Carolina and our country, or baking (one of my favorite hobbies, especially during quarantine)! I'll be on around 3 PM EST to answer your questions.\n\nProof:  https://i.redd.it/36idpf4877051.jpg\n\nEDIT: This was a lot of fun, y\u2019all! Thanks for the great questions. Definitely follow us on social media and check out our website to sign up for updates on the race - jaimeharrison.com. I truly believe that we not only have a shot at this, but that we are going to beat Lindsey and bring back common sense and decency to the Senate. Have a great day and a great Memorial Day weekend, y\u2019all! Live long and prosper!"}, {"subreddit": "technology", "label": 5, "post": "Comcast to customer: Yes, we promised you a price. We refuse to honor our quote, despite the audio recording you've provided. I got pushed around by Comcast yesterday. They can do what they want, since I have no other options. http://youtu.be/PRLgG9ctZGg\n[](http://youtu.be/PRLgG9ctZGg)\n\nEDIT: I'm glad this is getting some attention. Last night I sent the video to We_Can_Help@cable.comcast.com and\necare@comcast.com , as well as the tips address for the Consumerist. Today I submitted an FCC complaint per the suggestion of /u/BarbwireCake. I've only received an automated response from Comcast so far. Some are suggesting that a class action lawsuit might be a catalyst for change; I'm not sure. I will update when I hear from someone.\n(12:17PST)\nFiled with BBB and posted to [twitter](https://twitter.com/Sweetlethargy/status/550033447729643520)\n(13:04PST)\n\nEDIT:\nI spoke with someone from Comcast Executive Customer Relations. He wanted to discuss my complaint, but refused to be recorded. I record all of my calls with creditors so that I won't be promised something that is never delivered. As I found out yesterday, it might not even matter if the call has been recorded. Luckily this thread got some attention today, so I might actually get help with this issue. He assured me that I would change my mind about Comcast after speaking with him but I declined to continue the conversation. I've obviously learned my lesson today about keeping accurate records, and I don't want to hear anymore crocodile tears or pseudo-promises.\nIn any case, he said he would email me details of our non-conversation, which I will place here:\n\n--\nHello /u/sweetlethargy, I regret not being able to consent to your recording our conversation due to  the nature of the reasons or possible intent that you may have for the recording. In reviewing the original and unedited version of your initial call, the agent gave you correct information on the service plan and promotional services at the time of the call. This is the product and service that you spoke about:\n\nInternet Plus 09/06 - 10/05 69.95\n\nIncludes Limited Basic, HBO, Streampix, a\nStandard Definition Digital Converter and\nRemote For The Primary Outlet, and\nPerformance Internet.\n\nService Discount -19.96\n\nTotal XFINITY TV $49.99 plus taxes and fees\n\nFranchise Fee 1.42\n\nUtility Tax 2.00\n\nPEG Access Support 0.28\n\nState Sales Tax 0.16\n\nFCC User Fee 0.09\n\nTotal Taxes, Surcharges & Fees $3.95 (these vary slightly per month and are only collected by Comcast)\n \nDocsis 3 Owned Mdm 09/06 - 10/05 0.00\n\nBlast! Internet Svc 09/06 - 10/05 11.00\n\nService Discount -11.00\n\nTotal XFINITY Internet $0.00 (this was added after your conversation with the agent as a bonus) which may have caused this confusion\n\nWe have extended this promotional offer as a gesture of good will for an additional 12 months as long as you understand that at the end of that term if you wish to keep it, it will be billed at its standard rate.\n--\n\nIt seems that they aren't accepting responsibility for anything, but they are offering me something. Here is my response. (All I want is what I was quoted):\n\n--\nBottom line: do I have 100mbps down, 25mbps up, no contract, at $53.85 total per month including taxes and all other fees for 12 months?\n--\n\nIm waiting for a response.\n\nFor people who were asking, I used the android app Automatic Call Recorder by Appliqato. Everyone should record conversations with their creditors to keep them accountable.\n(18:24PST)\n\n**FINAL UPDATE:**\n\nJust spoke with an \"Executive Customer Relations Supervisor\" who apologized for the actions of the two customer retention reps, as well as the Executive Customer Relations rep who refused to be recorded yesterday. She was very polite, took full responsibility for Comcast's mistakes, and allowed me to record our conversation. She explained that \"both representatives you reached were freshly out of a training class\" and they \"should've placed you on hold\" to get more information. This is strange, since I could clearly hear the second rep being coached on what to say... \n\nIn any case, the Executive Customer Relations Supervisor said she would credit me a month of service as a sign of good will. She also explained that I would be receiving the promotional rate through August 15th 2015, however, due to the fluctuation of taxes and fees, she could not guarantee my final cost of $53.85. This month the final cost would be $55.55, for example. I indicated that all I wanted was the out-the-door $53.85 cost that I was quoted in August. I agree that the dollar amount is negligable, but all I've wanted is the price I was quoted when I agreed to keep the service. She agreed to credit my account $5 every month so that at no time I would be expected to pay more than $53.85.\n\nToday I Learned that if Comcast pushes you around, the best course of action is to expose them on social media. I can honestly say that this has been easier, less time consuming, and less stressful to make and post the video than it would've been to dial 1-800-COMCAST again. I hope these Comcast horror stories continue to get posted so that something might change one day. Proper competition is the only answer to this solution, and I personally feel that public utilies should also operate as ISPs.\n\nEveryone should be recording their interactions with creditors, as it is obviously the only way to keep them (somewhat) honest. It's sad that I was granted my simple request only after my video had been posted to the Consumerist, Techdirt, BGR, Gawker, yahoo, etc, etc... I realize that most people will simply never receive help with their complaints.\n\nGood luck to all of you who are dealing with similar situations.\n\n**tldr; I'm now getting what I was quoted: 100mbps down, 25mbps up, through August 15th, no contract, for no more than $53.85 per month.**\n\n(12/31/2014 11:08PST)\n"}, {"subreddit": "science", "label": 2, "post": "The brains of people with excellent general knowledge are particularly efficiently wired, finds a new study by neuroscientists using a special form of MRI, which found that people with a very efficient fibre network had more general knowledge than those with less efficient structural networking.

I read the 5 ASOIAF books and I had thought the women characters were really well done, so to see such a negative response made me think that perhaps I had missed something in his stories, or perhaps I had some negative beliefs or ideas about women that I didn't realize and that's why I missed those aspects of the story. I don't want to have any negative ideas about women, as I believe that all people are equal, but how else would I have missed that part of his story telling? So I'm hoping that I can get some examples from the stories related to women and how poorly GRRM treats them, and I'd love it even more if I could also get an analysis of why the scene in question is problematic.

Well everything worked but the program took about 25 seconds to load, which was annoying. I spent the whole day today trying to find clever ways to load the data faster - and came up with a bunch of possible solutions - the fastest of which was loading everything concurrently with threads.\n\nIt still was kind of slow. Just at the end of the day the solution came to me - I could delete all the pre-load nonsense and the \"cache on-demand\" will just do the work if and when it's needed. It worked perfectly. The loading time at the start went from 25 seconds to 2 seconds, and everything else was running perfectly (with a tiny lag here and there when data is being loaded for the first time).

Why didn't Fred and George ever say something about Ron being with a man named Peter throughout book 1 and 2? The final book also wasn't as good of a payoff either. The hallows just came out of nowhere, instead of focusing on the horcruxes like it should've (in my opinion).

I think the way characters interact is really great, until the 5th book where Harry becomes an edgy angst lord. There are just so many things I realize isn't all that great about this series. Please tell me what you think.\n\nEdit: A lot of people are trying to defend the guarding method of the stone, but I'm sorry. You're wrong. First of all, by locks, I mean things that would lock it up. Not literal locks. So don't go on about Alohomora, even though it is explained that Flitwick put on a spell that would make Alohomora useless in the room with the flying keys. Yes, a giant plant monster works, but how about something that isn't taught to 1st years? Why put the key that opens the door in a room with said door? Why even let anyone go through if they could solve a riddle like the one snape made? Just have it so that the fire is guarding it. Don't have the way to go through it lying in front of it.  Why should anyone even be able to get through the wall of fire, whether they are smart or not? Why have the key to unlocking every obstacle in front of you? It doesn't matter it's difficult to do it, why even have it in the first place? The possibility of getting through the obstacle may be slim if the key is difficult, but if the key isn't even there in the first place, the obstacle is impossible to go through.

Pictured - the Natural History Museum "}, {"subreddit": "music", "label": 6, "post": "Can we just take a moment to unironically appreciate \u201cWalkin\u2019 on the Sun\u201d by Smash Mouth? I know, I know, believe me, *I know*, but listen, can we just \u2014 for a minute \u2014 forget about *Shrek* and memes and eggs and Guy Fieri, and overcome our knee-jerk cynicism, and consider that this might actually be a better song than we give it credit for?\n\nThere\u2019s actually a lot more going on there than I knew back in the late \u201890s when it was all over the radio. Key to my newfound appreciation of it is reading the lyrics, most of which I couldn\u2019t actually make out just from listening. Here they are, in their entirety:\n\n> It ain't no joke, I'd like to buy the world a toke\n\n> And teach the world to sing in perfect harmony\n\n> And teach the world to snuff the fires and the liars\n\n> Hey, I know it's just a song but it's spice for the recipe\n\n\n\n> This is a love attack, I know, went out but it's back\n\n> It's just like any fad, it retracts before impact\n\n> And just like fashion, it's a passion for the with it and hip\n\n> If you got the goods, they'll come and buy it just to stay in the clique\n\n\n> So don't delay, act now, supplies are running out\n\n> Allow, if you're still alive, six to eight years to arrive\n\n> And if you follow, there may be a tomorrow\n\n> But if the offer\u2019s shunned, you might as well be walkin' on the sun\n\n\n> Twenty-five years ago, they spoke out and they broke out\n\n> Of recession and oppression and together they toked\n\n> And they folked out with guitars around a bonfire\n\n> Just singin' and clappin', man, what the hell happened there?\n\n\n> Some were spellbound, some were hellbound\n\n> Some, they fell down and some got back up\n\n> And fought back against the meltdown\n\n> And their kids were hippie chicks or hypocrites\n\n> Because fashion is smashin' the true meaning of it\n\n\n> So don't delay, act now, supplies are running out\n\n> Allow, if you're still alive, six to eight years to arrive\n\n> And if you follow, there may be a tomorrow\n\n> But if the offer\u2019s shunned, you might as well be walkin' on the sun\n\n\n> And it ain't no joke when a mama's handkerchief is soaked\n\n> With her tears because her baby's life has been revoked\n\n> The bond is broke up, so choke up and focus on the close up\n\n> Mr. Wizard can't reform, no God-like hocus-pocus\n\n> So don't sit back, kick back and watch the world get bushwhacked\n\n> News at ten, your neighborhood is under attack\n\n> Put away the crack before the crack puts you away\n\n> You need to be there when your baby's old enough to relate\n\n\n> So don't delay, act now, supplies are running out\n\n> Allow, if you're still alive, six to eight years to arrive\n\n> And if you follow, there may be a tomorrow\n\n> But if the offer\u2019s shunned, you might as well be walkin' on the sun\n\n\nI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s Dylan, but those lyrics are much more clever and intricate than they appear on first listen. Reading the lyrics also gives me the impression that the song is less cynical and sarcastic than I originally thought. I used to think it was just making fun of hippies, and how Baby Boomers abandoned their principles, and how the hippie movement was co-opted into a fashion statement. But giving it a closer look, the singer sounds genuinely sad and angry that we\u2019ve forgotten the ideals behind the fashion.\n\nI completely missed the meaning of the lines, \u201cAnd if you follow, there may be a tomorrow / But if the offer\u2019s shunned, you might as well be walkin\u2019 on the sun.\u201d Maybe I\u2019m reading too much into it, but to me this sounds less dismissive and more apocalyptic. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s talking about global thermonuclear war or global warming, or both, but the impression I get from these lines is: the hippie ethos of peace and love and living in harmony with the earth is not just nice to think about; it\u2019s necessary for our survival as a species. And if we as a society don\u2019t reconnect with that, we will *literally destroy ourselves*. And these fuckers turned it into a meaningless fashion statement and sold it back to us as New Beetles and flared jeans, and now the only remnant of this incredibly vital counterculture is more widespread use of substances that *destroy people\u2019s lives*. I mean, that\u2019s fucking horrible! \n\nAnd seeing those lines that way casts new light on the part, \u201cAllow, if you\u2019re still alive...\u201d I used to think that was just making fun of Baby Boomers for being old, and/or the endless cycle of old fads becoming cool again. But in light of \u201cAnd if you follow, there may be a tomorrow,\u201d it sounds more like a warning.\n\nFunnily enough, it\u2019s now been almost 25 years since this song was released. And the ice caps are melting at a terrifyingly fast rate and we are, thanks to Trump, once again perilously close to nuclear war. And we\u2019re all kind of avoiding thinking about it by drowning ourselves in exactly the sort of distractions this song is about (drugs, consumerism, etc.). The hippies\u2019 offer was definitively shunned, and now we\u2019re closer than ever to our own destruction.\n\nThis is a surprisingly good song, man. It\u2019s catchy, well-crafted, and well-written, with something to say and actual relevance to our time. Laugh at me all you want, but I\u2019ve got genuine respect for Smash Mouth right now.\n\nAlso, the first person to comment \u201csomeBODY once told me\u201d is getting downvoted so hard their grandchildren will lose karma.\n\nEdit: Added formatting for clarity."}, {"subreddit": "python", "label": 1, "post": "I made a command-line tool that instantly fetches Stack Overflow results when you get a compiler error "}, {"subreddit": "gaming", "label": 3, "post": "Divorced parents don\u2019t communicate.

We (my wife, our 7yo son 3yo daughter, and myself) lost our house to a fire last May. My collection was just over 1100 books, and I truly loved every single one of them. I went through every identifiable item in the house with the inventory specialist our insurance company sent, because I don't really have an emotional attachment to any of the \"things,\" whereas my wife sobbed at even the thought of seeing it. Fast forward to Christmas. Behind the boxes of Legos for our son, and the princess gear for our daughter, were stack after stack of books, lovingly picked by my beautiful wife. Stephen Ambrose, Aldous Huxley, Ken Follett, William Golding... 35 books in all. Hard to explain to her why I couldn't muster a single tear in the hospital when our daughter was born, yet couldn't stop the biblical torrent streaming down my 38yo cheeks because of a few King novels. \n\nUpdate: Thank you all so much for the responses! I didn't expect this much outpouring of support and well-wishes, and don't really know how to process it. It feels wrong to, for lack of a better way of putting it, mourn the loss of \"things.\" We were out when the fire happened, so no one was hurt (our two cats were home but came out of it unscathed), and grieving over possessions leaves me with an overwhelming feeling of guilt. I guess that's what led to my post in the first place. Having an emotional response to this beautiful gift has left me feeling more things than I know how to process, and writing about it has, surprisingly, helped. \n\nThank you all again. \n\n\nUpdate 2: Holy cow! This community is incredible! I have received so many offers to send books, that I can't keep up with them all. I would humbly accept any and all books that anyone would like to send. I would like to apologize if I didn't respond to you directly. I appreciate each and every one of you. Our address is **P.O.Box 6865 Spokane, WA 99217**.

(Prime price is 20 bucks) What a deal! I thought, and soon after I ordered, I got that feeling of dread you get when you think that something may be too good to be true.

Their items for sale included pretty much the entirety of best sellers on Amazon. \n\nI did a quick google for JAMESHALEY and found a blog post detailing the scam. Scammers will open up new selling accounts, listing almost every book imaginable at an unbeatable price, knowing that due to Amazon's 1-click purchase feature, they will get a lot of hits. Of course the shoppers will cancel their order, but more than likely they will already have your Name, Address, & Phone #, which is what the scam sets out to accomplish. \n\nI immediately contacted Amazon about the incident and reported the seller. They sent me a swift response and even credited $5 for my trouble. So today I am browsing for books again and lo and behold, a different seller name has a great price, same situation.

Click here.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/3hgbr3/update_ryan_adams_tweeted_about_my_music_to/?)\n\nI make music as Christopher the Conquered. Just over 1 week ago, Ryan Adams tweeted a photo of my new album (unreleased, it doesn't come out until next year) with the text: \"You guys @ctconquered is the real deal. This record is blowing my mind!!!\" Here's a link: https://twitter.com/TheRyanAdams/status/627930152379351040\n\nHe also posted it on Instagram with: \"This is a crazy and incredible record. Holy shit. Congrats @ctconquered\" Here's that link: https://instagram.com/p/55LLUtTDBl/\n\n\nFirst of all, I need to say I am very thankful to Ryan for sharing my music. There's nothing in it for him, so it's just very sweet of him. So thank you, Ryan!\n\nI have never met Ryan Adams. I played a show opening for the wonderful Natalie Prass and gave her an advance copy of the cd. It seems to have made its way from Iowa (where I live) to Los Angeles, where Ryan lives. Therefore, I owe Natalie a thank you, as well!\n\nObviously, I was very surprised to see these posts, and after overcoming the initial shock, it occurred to me that I should try to quantify the effect of these posts. We'll call it the \"Ryan Adams bump\". :)\n\nSo, 1 week later, what's happened? Well, I'm not playing on the late night circuit or anything like that, but I did get a lot of interest in my music. Here's how the last week has played out:\n\n* Website Page Views - 2489 Views\n* Youtube Videos: 1653 New Views\n* Soundcloud: Single from Album - 572 Plays\n* Facebook: 82 New Likes\n* Instagram: 40 New Followers\n* Twitter: 31 New Followers\n* Spotify: 28 New Followers\n* Email Newsletter: 12 Signups\n* Internet Sales (Not including iTunes, Spotify, etc. - that takes a while to get those numbers): $86\n\n\nI took a look at the analytics for what I could above (website, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter) and for the rest I can basically speak anecdotally.\n\n* My website was averaging about 30 page views a day before the posts. The day of the post, I got 999 page views. It's been dropping exponentially since then, about to be back to it's \"normal\" state. We'll see if the overall average ups a little.\n\n* YouTube videos saw a 701% growth over the previous week! Whoa.\n\n* The single off the album on Soundcloud had pretty much tapered off after its release in April around 900 plays, get a couple a day since the mid-June. It had 950 plays right when Ryan posted, that jumped up to 1572 within one week.\n\n* Facebook was a 179% growth in likes from the previous week. Not bad.\n\n* Instagram is hard to tell, definitely a jump in follows, though!\n\n* Twitter analytics, interestingly, say that my increase was in line with growth since the beginning of July...I did play a big festival then...I would've expected a noticeable bump here.\n\n* Spotify followers had definitely tapered off, so that was a noticeable boost! Now that I have over 250 followers though, I can verify my artist profile and get analytics on that...not sure if I'll be able to look back at this time period though. \n\n* I had zero email signups and zero internet sales the week before this, and honestly, my weekly averages had been close to zero for a while. So definitely a bump there. It'll be interesting to see how revenues from digital music outlets are affected.\n\n\n\nNow I did get two other pieces of press in this week, one on Noisey.Vice.com and one on PureVolume.com (a new music video). So it's not clear that all of the increases are due strictly to the \"Ryan Adams bump\", but undoubtedly he gave me a lot of momentum. And experience tells me that those other press bits wouldn't amount to much.\n\nWhat I'm curious about is if these numbers could be extrapolated to predict the effect of being personally advocated for by a celebrity? Taylor Swift (whose album 1989 Ryan Adams is currently creating a cover version of in the style of The Smiths) has 100 times the number of Twitter followers that Ryan does. Would it be reasonable to expect that if she posted about my music, I would see 100 times the above numbers in impact?\n\n**Anyone else have experience with having your music posted by people with loads of followers?**\n\nAnyway, thanks again to Ryan Adams, and if you want to hear the title track from the album he is touting, you can here: http://www.christophertheconquered.com/im-giving-up-on-rock-roll-single-2015/\n\n\nThanks!\n\nDue to popular request, pre-orders are now available!

Sometimes it takes 30 minutes or so for the code to become active just after I create it, so if it doesn't work, go ahead and try again a while later.\n\nUdemy has changed their coupon policies, and I'm now only allowed to make 3 coupon codes each month with several restrictions. Hence why each code only lasts 3 days. **I won't be able to make codes after this period**, but I will be making free codes next month.\n\nYou can also purchase the course at a discount using my code APR2020 or MAY2020 (or whatever month/year it is) or clicking https://inventwithpython.com/automateudemy to redirect to the latest discount code.

Signing up gives you lifetime access so you can work on it at your own pace.\n* This Udemy course covers roughly the same content as the 1st edition book (the book has a little bit more, but all the basics are covered in the online course), which you can read for free online at https://inventwithpython.com\n* The 2nd edition of Automate the Boring Stuff with Python is now available online: https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/\n* I do plan on updating the Udemy course for the second edition, but it'll take a while because I have other book projects I'm working on. Expect that update to happen in mid- or late-2020. If you sign up for this Udemy course, you'll get the updated content automatically once I finish it. It won't be a separate course.\n* It's totally fine to start on the first edition and then read the second edition later. I'll be writing a blog post to guide first edition readers to the parts of the second edition they should read.\n* I wrote a blog post to cover [what's new in the second edition](https://inventwithpython.com/blog/2019/10/07/whats-new-in-the-2nd-edition-of-automate-the-boring-stuff-with-python/)\n* **You're not too old to learn to code.

We'll direct people to [BattleForTheNet.com](https://www.battleforthenet.com), an optimized action site that easily allows anyone to submit a comment to the FCC and Congress at the same time, make a phone call, and sign up to participate in meetings with lawmakers. We'll also have video bumpers that YouTubers and other video creators can use. Basically, everyone should think about how they can use the power of the Internet to reach their audience with a message abotu net neutrality and make it easy for them to take action.\n\n**Important context from my previous update below.**\n\nNet neutrality is the basic principle that prevents Internet Service Providers like Comcast and Verizon from charging us extra fees to access the online content we want -- or throttling, blocking, and censoring websites and apps. Title II is the legal framework for net neutrality, and the FCC is trying to get rid of it, under immense pressure for the Cable lobby.\n\nThis day of action is an incredibly important moment for the Internet to come together -- across political lines -- and show that we don't want our Cable companies controlling what we can do online, or picking winners and losers when it comes to streaming services, games, and online content.\n\nThe current FCC chairman, Ajit Pai, is a former Verizon lawyer and seems intent on getting rid of net neutrality and misleading the public about it. But the FCC has to answer to Congress. If we can create another moment of massive online protest like the SOPA Blackout and the Internet Slowdown, we have a real chance of stopping the FCC in its tracks, and protecting the Internet as a free and open platform for creativity, innovation, and exchange of ideas. \n\nSo! If you've got a website, blog, Tumblr, or any kind of social media following, or if you are a subreddit mod or active in an online community or forum, please get involved! There's so much we as redditors can do, from blacking out our sites to drive emails and phone calls to organizing in-person meetings with our lawmakers. Feel free to message me directly or email team (at) fightforthefuture (dot) org to get involved, and **[learn more here.](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12)**\n\n**EDIT:** Oh hai, everyone! Very glad you're here. Lots of awesome brainstorming happening in the comments. Keep it coming. A lot of people are asking what sites will be doing on July 12. We're still encouraging brainstorming and creativity, but the basic idea is that sites will have a few options of things they can do to their homepage to show what the web would be like without net neutrality, ie a slow loading icon to show they are stuck in the slow lane, a \"site blocked\" message to show they could be censored, or an \"upgrade your Internet service to access this site\" fake paywall to show how we could be charged special fees to access content. Love all your ideas! Keep sharing, and **[go here for more info about the protest.](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12)**\n\n**EDIT 2:** It's worth noting that given the current chairman of the FCC's political orientation, it's extra important that conservatives, libertarians, and others to the right of center speak out on this issue. The cable lobby is working super hard to turn this technological issue into a partisan circus. We can't let them. Net neutrality protects free speech, free markets, innovation, and economic opportunity. We need people and sites from all across the political spectrum to be part of this.

I hate being this picky but when I know the original cover art for the book is nice I don't want a film poster on it. I almost don't even want to get the book.

Maybe I should read it with an open mind?\n\n- [Pillars of The Earth by Ken Follet](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5043.The_Pillars_of_the_Earth): Like East of Eden, I don't know if this book is for me, but who knows?\n\n- [Dune by Frank Herbert](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44767458-dune): I would love to read this, but sadly my bookstore will probably only sell it when the actual Dune movie comes out, with a bookcover that looks like the movieposter. :/\n\n- [The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7126.The_Count_of_Monte_Cristo): I *need* that book in my life!\n\n\nThere are of course a whole lot of other suggestions, but since I'm not the biggest reader, these books seem like a good way to start (for me atleast)!\n\nI also think that I need to move to another country.

You really expect me to believe your name is Amadeus, your best friends are named Opal, Fauna, Mirabelle, Jaysen and idk probably Cosmo and Wanda.\n\nPersonally, I understand not wanting to give everyone a common name. I see the downsides of that too. But really. Just me?\n\n\nEdit: As many have pointed out, it makes total sense for characters to have uncommon names in fantasy and sci-fi books. I hadn't even thought about that when making this post, I was more thinking of realistic fiction books that take place in modern times.\n\nAlso, this was not meant as an attack on unusual, unique, uncommon, etc. names in general. What I meant was, it feels unrealistic when almost every character in the book has a name that I, in my experience, rarely if ever hear in real life.\n\nBy the way, Cosmo and Wanda is just a reference to the Nickelodeon cartoon Fairly Odd Parents. It's just a joke. I knew someone irl named Wanda and she was an excellent cook and cool person. So yes it's not that uncommon.\n\nMy list of names was not some super thought out, flawless example. It was mostly random names I thought of that I remembered reading or hearing. I'm sure other commenters have better examples than that. By the way unique does not mean bad. In no way did I mean that.

I was doing some reading about the history of [Shrek](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a7/Shrekcover.jpg) (long story), and learned that it was a children\u2019s book written ten years before the movie came out.\n\nNot only that, but it was written by William Steig--who you might recognize as 1. A super prolific children's author ([Dr. De Soto](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fa/CoverofDoctordesoto.gif), Sylvester and the Magic Pebble), or 2. The most-ever published author and illustrator in the [New Yorker](https://images.fineartamerica.com/images-medium-large-5/new-yorker-february-15th-1964-william-steig.jpg) (in 73 years he worked for them, he produced 2600 drawings and 117 covers).\n\nIn short, the guy who wrote Shrek! in 1990 had some serious literary chops.\n\nCurious, I picked up a copy. It\u2019s great, and not what I was expecting. Here are the best parts:\n\n1. **Shrek has super powers.** He gets bit by a snake. The snake dies. He breathes fire, and can spit a flame 99 yards and vent smoke from his ears. He cooks a pheasant with his eyes. He eats lightening.\n2. **The art is UGLY in an endearing and iconic way.** I\u2019ve never been a fan of \u201cugly art\u201d a la Ren and Stimpy, but there is [something endearing about the way Shrek and his malevolence](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/41/36/39/41363963004818debd4c2269b3464ebd.jpg) are depicted. The art fits the theme.\n3. **The Verbs are great.** Toddled, spit, cowed, convulsed, hissed things over, kicked, hatched, cackled, crowed, cried, scythed, mumbled...that\u2019s in the first few pages.\n4. **It isn\u2019t Disney-fied.** Shrek does not look for redemption. He is a monster. He is hideous. He hates kind things. He still finds a princess (just as hideous), and gets hitched.\n\nAnd I think that\u2019s the best part. Steig doesn\u2019t use the ogre to make some point about inner beauty, or redemption, or grace.\n\nIn the book\u2019s climax, Shrek has to confront his own horrifying visage in a hall of mirrors. This is the perfect spot for Steig to shoehorn in a lesson--for Shrek to look at what he is, reflect on his journey, and learn the error of his ways. Instead, Steig writes:\n\n>***\u201cHe faced himself, full of rabid self-esteem...happier than ever to be exactly what he was.\u201d***\n\nThen he marries the princess.\n\nSo Shrek has literary origins!

I did want to make a program so that even my friends could solve a rubik's cube without knowing anything about it. Hence that I've also added a humanized-notation where all the rubik's cube notation gets converted into humanized sentences such as:\n\n```\n1. Turn the back side 180 degrees.\n2. Turn the top layer 180 degrees.\n3. Turn the front side a quarter turn to the left.\n4. Turn the right side a quarter turn away from you.\n...\n```\n\nI've started this project almost 6 years ago when I was still studying and got a decent-working version, but the color detection only worked for my room and my lightning setup. Many things were hard for me since I was still studying programming.\n\nAfter roughly 6 years (and working professionally for already 6+ years), I got a nice suggestion from someone else on one of my issues on how to improve the color detection using LAB colors + the CIEDE2000 color-distance algorithm. This worked insanely good and got me really accurate results (assuming a room had regular lighting). Due to my knowledge I've built up in the last years, this was much easier after all those years.\n\nI also improved the cube-detection algorithm. My program can detect different types of 3x3x3 cubes whether edges are circular or a bit rounded or a perfect square. The detection works really well.\n\nI've also added a *calibrate mode* in order the let the user calibrate it's cube if the default settings are not working out for you due to the room you're in or if the color scheme that you're using on your rubik's cube is being recognized incorrectly. After having it calibrated, if your room has proper light, then this will give you a 99.9% guarantee that your colors will be detected properly.\n\nI'm really proud of the project and would like to share it with everyone. Feel free to try it out. I'm open to any feedback. If there are any issues or you have feature requests, I suggest you to create an issue at the repository.\n\nThanks.\n\nEDIT: For those who ever need to do some color detection: using the CIEDE2000 algorithm is especially designed to work with LAB colors for the purpose of color detection. Using this will give you accurate color-detected results. Those who did the same project like me probably used HSV or something similar. This is not going to cover different situations in terms of the lighting in a room and you'll never be able to get accurate results, unless you use some kind of machine learning, but that's just over-engineering your project. My project is a proof that color detection can be done properly just with OpenCV, LAB colors and some pre-existing algorithms that can help out."}, {"subreddit": "python", "label": 1, "post": "Interactive Coronavirus Spreading Map in Python "}, {"subreddit": "technology", "label": 5, "post": "Twitter CEO: 'Not true' that removing Trump campaign video was illegal, as president has claimed "}, {"subreddit": "books", "label": 4, "post": "I'm 25 and I just read Fahrenheit 451 for the first time.

So I read the hobbit again, but unfortunately I couldn't get myself to start with LOTR, partly because I bough all three books in one and it looked intimidating to finish, and partly because I started with university and I didn't have much time on my hands till beginning of this summer. \n\nI start with the fellowship beginning of July and it just hits me hard with nostalgia of the hobbit.

He paints a picture and explains in a way that I would've never thought I'm capable of imagining. \n\nToday I just finished \"The return of the king\" and it's bitter sweet end to me.

At the beginning of the book Bilbo is celebrating his 111th birthday, and a year after that Frodo leaves the shire, when Bilbo is 112. Now after they come back from mount doom, gandalf sits with Frodo and tells him that although it might feel long ago that he started out of the shire, it's only less than a year since then. And that timeline was mentioned I think a few times after. But when they are on their way back to rivendell and celebrate Bilbo's birthday, he is turning 129.

Two weeks ago there was a school shooting at a Noblesville Middle school (and threats at the High School). Luckily there were no fatalities, and only 3 injured (2 students and 1 teacher who tackled the shooter). Regardless I was curious how Foster The People would approach what is arguably their most well known song so soon after such an event took place.\n\nI have to say, I respect Mark Foster for how this was handled. They could have easily glossed over the message of the song, but instead took several minutes afterwards to address not only the Noblesville shooting, including the victims and heroes specifically, but other tragedies that have become so common in the US. He asked us to treat mental illness as a serious affliction, encouraged us to show compassion to others and that having a plan to prevent this from happening in the future would be amazing, but that loving each other is the first step. \n\nThe band didn\u2019t have to make that statement, but they did and that goes a long way in my eyes.\n\nedit: Regardless of your opinion on the band, what the actual meaning of the song is, or the sensationalism that surrounds the mass shootings in America, I think the real takeaway is something much more important. Mental illness is real. Every day I work with children as young as 5 years old who suffer from social anxiety, self harm, severe anger issues, and a multitude of other behavioral disorders that not only affect their ability to form healthy relationships with peers, but also affect their ability to succeed in school.

Supporting and loving others can make a massive difference in anyone's life. \n\nedit 2: I would also like to reach out at this point and thank any and all of the officers who went to the different schools in the districts surrounding the incident, especially on the day we were having, with parents coming in and out to check out the 5th grade talent show.

Signing up gives you lifetime access so you can work on it at your own pace.\n* This Udemy course covers roughly the same content as the 1st edition book (the book has a little bit more, but all the basics are covered in the online course), which you can read for free online at https://inventwithpython.com\n* The 2nd edition of Automate the Boring Stuff with Python is free online: https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/\n* I do plan on updating the Udemy course for the second edition, but it'll take a while because I have other book projects I'm working on. Expect that update to happen in mid-2021. If you sign up for this Udemy course, you'll get the updated content automatically once I finish it. It won't be a separate course.\n* It's totally fine to start on the first edition and then read the second edition later. I'll be writing a blog post to guide first edition readers to the parts of the second edition they should read.\n* I wrote a blog post to cover [what's new in the second edition](https://inventwithpython.com/blog/2019/10/07/whats-new-in-the-2nd-edition-of-automate-the-boring-stuff-with-python/)\n* **You're not too old to learn to code. You don't need to be \"good at math\" to be good at coding.**\n* Signing up is the first step.

They have made me create a new ID and assured to provide me everything back but I still haven't got all of my games (including Battlefield 5 Pre-Order) and my soldier name i.e. FlyingOfficer.\n\n# Update 7:  \n\nI have got a response from EA just minutes ago and they are working on something although what they are offering is not what I want.  All I want is my games that I paid for (I have valid bank transaction IDs) and my soldier name i.e. \"FlyingOfficer\".  I will update once they confirm me on this. So far on a higher level they have told me that \"We cannot assure anything at this moment\".\n\n# Update 8: \n\nSarah from EA has helped me in getting my soldier ID back (FlyingOfficer) and added most of all the games (Except for Battlefield V Pre-Order) into my new account. She has also provided me 12 months of free Origin Premier membership ( I didn't ask for this). Although my stats history is gone I am quite satisfied that I got my soldier ID back. Waiting for them to restore my Battlefield V Pre-Order.\n\n[https://i.redd.it/764limsw8pf11.jpg](https://i.redd.it/764limsw8pf11.jpg)\n\n# Update 9: \n\nBattlefield 5 Pre-Order has been restored into my Origin Account.\n\n# Update 10: \n\nMy Battlefield 1 Stats have been restored.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**LETTER OF THANKS**:\n\n**A big thanks to the gaming community who came in hordes to support me (brings tears in my eyes, literally)** while all doors were closed for me and EA Help shamelessly rejected my support requests. Had I not got this much of support, I don't think I would have ever thought of going back to Battlefield.>>Having said that **I want to strongly back the developers (i.e. DICE) of Battlefield and the Franchise itself as they have delivered to us some of the best First Person Shooters in last 15 years.** This incident and events that have unfolded thereafter (including the immense support from the good guys in this world) will be an unforgettable experience for me and **my support and enthusiasm for Battlefield 5 the future releases will be the same as ever**. For the game and the developer Studio DICE, I have only accolades and I have always wanted this franchise to win the competition. Although when it comes to Electronic Arts. I do have a lot of complaints and won't stop criticizing it for being so money hungry and pathetic (especially User Support and Business Strategies). I wish DICE wasn't associated with EA but that is far from getting real. **I request all of you to not lose your trust in Battlefield and the developers who have put their heart and soul in bringing Battlefield to us.**\\>>The key takeaway is that none of us should remain silent when mammoths in the industry try to suppress us and we should give corrupt people a strong fight. If EA doesn't know how to treat us then let's teach them, all together. Let's make videos and post which highlight the security and data retention flaws of EA.>>Thanks,>>(Samarjit Roy Choudhury)>>Origin ID: FlyingOfficer>>Thanks to YouTubers, [Drop Rate](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRJsZ5d8QdIvaoxCNV9KyLg), [SidAlpha](https://www.youtube.com/user/GreyWolf779) & [ReviewTechUSA](https://www.youtube.com/user/ReviewTechUSA) for making videos on this issue:>>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5zPyD0SA0Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5zPyD0SA0Y)\\>>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uu67uPlezCs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uu67uPlezCs)\\>>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ls64hxpqt\\_E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ls64hxpqt_E)\n\nThanks to Gaming News Channels/Blogs who covered this issue:\n\n[https://gamerant.com/ea-origin-account-deleted-reddit/](https://gamerant.com/ea-origin-account-deleted-reddit/)\n\n[https://www.oneangrygamer.net/\u2026/ea-origin-user-has-a\u2026/66237/](https://www.oneangrygamer.net/2018/08/ea-origin-user-has-all-his-games-deleted-proving-dangers-of-all-digital-future/66237/)\n\n[https://www.vgr.com/ea-stonewalls-deleted-origin-account/](https://www.vgr.com/ea-stonewalls-deleted-origin-account/)\n\n[https://gamingbolt.com/battlefield-5-player-accuses-ea-of-d\u2026](https://gamingbolt.com/battlefield-5-player-accuses-ea-of-deleting-their-origin-account-containing-100s-of-games)\n\n[https://www.bleedingcool.com/\u2026/player-accuses-ea-deleting-\u2026/](https://www.bleedingcool.com/2018/08/11/player-accuses-ea-deleting-account/)\n\n[https://gameplaying.info/ea-deleted-the-gamers-account-all\u2026/](https://gameplaying.info/ea-deleted-the-gamers-account-allegedly-at-his-request/)\n\n[https://www.w3livenews.com/News/ReadArticle](https://www.w3livenews.com/News/ReadArticle)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can reach out to me @\n\n[https://twitter.com/FlyingOffr](https://twitter.com/FlyingOffr)\n\nYou can reach out to Battlefield India Community at\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/graedxbmm9261.png?width=912&format=png&auto=webp&s=53d66f9379992606df15d06c02c36d679b5f00c8\n\n[https://twitter.com/battlefieldInd](https://twitter.com/battlefieldInd)\n\n[https://fb.com/battlefield.in](https://fb.com/battlefield.in)\n\n[http://Discord.Battlefield.Community](http://Battlefield.Community)\n\n[http://BattlefieldIndia.com](http://BattlefieldIndia.com)\n\n&#x200B;"}, {"subreddit": "technology", "label": 5, "post": "Facebook Groups Are Destroying America "}, {"subreddit": "gaming", "label": 3, "post": "As a teen in the 80s, my conservative God-fearing family wouldn't let me own Dungeons & Dragons.

The raspberry pi runs a series of speedtests every hour and stores the data. Whenever the downspeed is below 50mbps the Pi uses a twitter API to send an automatic tweet to Comcast listing the speeds. \n\nI know some people might say I should not be complaining about 50mpbs down, but when they advertise 150 and I get 10-30 I am unsatisfied. I am aware that the Pi that I have is limited to ~100mbps on its Ethernet port (but seems to top out at 90) so when I get 90 I assume it is also higher and possibly up to 150.\n\nComcast has noticed and every time I tweet they will reply asking for my account number and address...usually hours after the speeds have returned to normal values. I have chosen not to provide them my account or address because I do not want to singled out as a customer; all their customers deserve the speeds they advertise, not just the ones who are able to call them out on their BS.\n\nThe Pi also runs a website server local to our network where with a graphing library I can [see the speeds over different periods of time](http://i.imgur.com/qdnnLzg.png).\n\n\n\nEDIT: A lot of folks have pointed out that the results are possibly skewed by our own network usage. We do not torrent in our house; we use the network to mainly stream TV services and play PC and Xbone live games. I set the speedtest and graph portion of this up (without the tweeting part) earlier last year when the service was so constatly bad that Netflix wouldn't go above 480p and I would have >500ms latencies in CSGO. I service was constantly below 10mbps down. I only added the Twitter portion of it recently and yes, admittedly the service has been better.\n\nPlenty of the drops were during hours when we were not home or everyone was asleep, and I  am able to download steam games or stream Netflix at 1080p and still have the speedtest registers its near its maximum of ~90mbps down, so when we gets speeds on the order of 10mpbs down and we are not heavily using the internet we know the problem is not on our end.\n\nEDIT 2: People asked for the source code. PLEASE USE THE CLEANED UP CODE BELOW.

"}, {"subreddit": "books", "label": 4, "post": "I fulfilled my ambition of reading IT. Due to my autism I have never been able to read novels and was told I never would, it just never worked for me. All I see is a jumble of words that don't seem to go anywhere in my mind. I also have no internal reading voice (well I do but it's just flat and monotone and has no emotional connection to words at all missing all the range and cadence needed to read) and on top of that my mind doesn't form any images unless I have already seen what Im trying to imagine. As you can see these factors make it almost impossible to read fiction novels. \n\nWell it took me a lot of hard work and a lot of time and concentration but I did it! I finally fulfilled my ambition of reading Stephen King's IT.\n\nThis ambition all started in the 90s when the IT miniseries first came out, I instantly fell in love with the whole thing from the characters to the place of Derry, Maine. I watched it so much that I knew it inside out, but I always knew by word of mouth that the book was a million times better.\n\nIve tried on and off to read this book but have always failed at pretty much page 1. Well after the new movies came out I was adamant I was gonna read this thing even if it killed me. \n\nI thought about my problems for a long time and finally came up with solutions to get past them... Basically I used the audiobook read by Steven Weber to replace my inner voice, I invested in the first edition to read along with (thoughts being that if I invested money it would be further incentive) and I sat in a dark room to block out all stimulus other than the words (using a reading lamp aimed only at the book). \n\nSo I started the audio book and read along with the voice and it worked, it started going in! His voice sort of became my own and because I'd seen the miniseries and movies I didn't have any issues knowing what things and people looked like.\n\nWell it took me since December but I finally reached the end and **OMG** what an amazing journey. Its probably been one of the greatest feelings and experiences in my life! I really can't get across enough how much I loved it. I struggle very much with emotions but this experience made me feel what I assume people refer to as emotion. The book is so so **SO** much better than any movie. I loved it so much that I am in the process of reading it again \ud83d\ude0a\n\nI just wanted to share this hoping it might inspire someone else to not give up on reading, it can enrich your life so much if you invest the time and effort. I also just wanted to share because I'm just so proud of myself.\n\nSorry this has been so long (and probably hard to make sense of, not great at writing either), but thank you for taking the time to read it.\n\n\nIT Fan.\n\n**For anyone wondering, my next book will be The Stand and my ultimate goal is to reach The Dark Tower. I will keep everyone updated with my progress in further posts.**\n\n**TWITTER EDIT** I contacted Stephen King on twitter as some of you told me to, I don't think he will reply but I tried. My twitter is @Autistic_IT_Fan if anyone wants to know. \n\n**edit** I didn't expect this much response, I'm blown away. Thank you everyone and I am trying my best to reply to you all. Sorry if I miss anyone but its very difficult to keep up. \ud83d\ude0a\n\n**edit 2** Wow, thank you for the awards everyone \ud83d\ude01 I never thought in a million years I would get this response, it's given me so much drive to continue my reading journey.\n\n**edit 3** Thank you so much everyone, I have never felt this much support or praise in my whole life. Its overwhelming. Thank you all for being so kind.\n\n* It has come to my attention that my autism may not be the only reasons for my struggles (aphantasia). so I apologise to anyone who has autism and can read perfectly well."}, {"subreddit": "politics", "label": 7, "post": "Adam Schiff Erupts: Closing Statement On Contentious Impeachment Hearing "}, {"subreddit": "python", "label": 1, "post": "I took some suggestions and improved my solar system generator with better rings and colorful stars "}, {"subreddit": "travel", "label": 9, "post": "While covid killed most of the travelling, I do enjoy New Zealand without tourists.

I got back into reading just a couple of months ago and I read a lot of fantasy in English (currently reading mistborn). A few days ago, I was interested in seeing if there are any fantasy classics from the Netherlands. So I looked up online, to see if there is some kind of \"Dutch Tolkien\". I couldn't find a lot, so I went and asked my Dutch Literature teacher if there is a fantasy genre in Dutch literature and if she knows of a \"Dutch Tolkien\". She told me bluntly that I shouldn't read fantasy and that she doesn't consider it to be \"real literature\". She basically thinks that Tolkien's books aren't \"real literature\".\n\nThat teacher is one of the biggest gatekeepers I know. She keeps rambling about how sad it is that kids don't read much anymore and then she literally claims that certain genres shouldn't be read. She's also one of those people who say that listening to audiobooks doesn't count as reading.\n\nWell I'm just gonna keep reading my \"not real literature\" and my teacher can continue being an ignorant gatekeeper.\n\nEdit: I wrote this post during my lunchbreak so I didn't have any time to respond to the comments since I was in class all this time. I'm going to discuss many of the points you guys brought up here with my teacher and I hope that I can convince her to perhaps change her views regarding fantasy.\n\nI also didn't expect so many comments so my post isn't as nuanced as it probably should be. I wrote it right after asking her and this post became more of a rant than I intended. I don't actually think that the teacher is an idiot, but she is unfortunately very close minded.\n\n*Keep in mind that she teaches Dutch literature in high school. I see many comments of people in the Netherlands or Belgium who have had the same experience with Dutch literature teachers, so this might be some form of Dutch snobbery or maybe it just has to do with the fact that the fantasy genre is very uncommon in literature here, so she thinks that it's only for kids. Either way, I would've expected her to be less of a gatekeeper and more of a teacher.*\n\nTo clarify about audiobooks: in Dutch schools you are required to choose a list 12 Dutch classic novels that you have to read in your 3 years of high school (if you do vwo). My teacher doesn't allow us to listen to any of these books on our list in audiobook format, because \"it's not reading\".\n\nAnother edit: wow this blew up and got way more upvotes and comments than I expected. Also thanks for all the great (Dutch fantasy) book recommendations. Apparently these kind of posts get posted very often, so I'm sorry for accidentaly making such a generic post while ranting about my Dutch teacher lol.

The way she wove the web of mystery, skullduggery and suspense was masterful. The nursery rhyme also added a sense of impending doom to myself as the reader. Really clever utilisation of dramatic irony.

However, I recommend starting on \u2018The Murder of Roger Ackoryd\u2019, if you haven\u2019t read any Agatha Christie before - it\u2019s a better introduction to her work.

It was good. I wish they had made it more true to the book, but it was still enjoyable viewing. Charles Dance was excellent. After you\u2019ve finished the book, you ought to watch it.

I started working in IT about 8 years ago and made my way to being a System Administrator for a small Supermarket chain. I am new to Python and the only language I know a little of is Powershell.\n\n**Why I want to learn Python:**\n\nThere are not a lot of practical skills that I learned on my own. So on December 28th, I decided to put my energy into learning how to code. I saw a post in r/powershell : [Powershell Guide to Python](https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerShell/comments/ab27n2/book_update_powershell_guide_to_python/) by  [u/Prateeksingh1590](https://www.reddit.com/user/Prateeksingh1590) and decided I wanted to learn Python. So I watched 2.5 hours out of the 4 hours from [this video for beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw&t=12978s). I also watched 2 hours of a [Lynda.com](https://Lynda.com) course, mainly reviewing what I had learned from [Mike Dane](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ).\n\n**The App:**\n\nAt one point, I wanted to know if I could code an app with the little basic knowledge I had. I thought about building an guessing word game. So I layed out want I wanted to achieve. I wanted the person guessing to have 3 information while guessing a word :\n\n1 - To know if the have more, less or equal the characters of the word\n\n2 - To know if they have some letters right\n\n3 - To if the letters that are right are in the right spot\n\n**Making the App:**\n\nSo I started my journey to make this app. It took me over a week and about 8-10 hours of trials and errors and googling to achieve the app. Watch out for yourself, it's pretty ugly. but it works.\n\n**Feedback is more than welcome**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n    from getpass import getpass\n    \n    word = getpass(\"Enter the secret word :\")\n    word = (word.lower())\n    word_compare = set(word)\n    word_char = len(word)\n    word_len = word_char\n    guess_word = \"\"\n    not_eno = \"Not enough characters in your guess\"\n    too_many = \"Too many characters in your guess\"\n    exactly = \"You have the exact number of characters in your guess\"\n    ok_letters = 0\n    count = 0\n    \n    while guess_word != word:\n        count += 1\n        guess_word = input('What is the secret word?')\n        guess_word = (guess_word.lower())\n        guess_char = len(guess_word)\n        guess_len = guess_char\n        guess_compare = set(guess_word)\n        same_char = word_compare & guess_compare\n        num_same_char = len(same_char)\n        if guess_word == word:\n            break\n        elif len(guess_word) != 0:\n            if word_char > guess_char:\n                word_char = guess_char\n            elif guess_char > word_char:\n                dif = guess_char - word_char\n                word_char = guess_char\n                for add_letters in range(dif):\n                    word = word + str(add_letters)\n            for num_letters in range(word_char):\n                if guess_word[num_letters] == word[num_letters]:\n                    ok_letters = ok_letters + 1\n            if guess_len < word_len:\n                print(\"This is try # \" + str(count) + \". \\n\"\n                      + str(not_eno) + \". \\n\"\n                      + \"You have \" + str(num_same_char) + \" good letter(s). \\n\"\n                      + \"You have \" + str(ok_letters) + \" letter(s) correctly placed.\")\n            elif guess_len > word_len:\n                print(\"This is try # \" + str(count) + \". \\n\"\n                      + str(too_many) + \". \\n\"\n                      + \"You have \" + str(num_same_char) + \" good letter(s). \\n\"\n                      + \"You have \" + str(ok_letters) + \" letter(s) correctly placed.\")\n            else:\n                print(\"This is try # \" + str(count) + \". \\n\"\n                      + str(exactly) + \". \\n\"\n                      + \"You have \" + str(num_same_char) + \" good letter(s). \\n\"\n                      + \"You have \" + str(ok_letters) + \" letter(s) correctly placed.\"\n                      )\n            ok_letters = 0\n        else:\n            print(\"You have entered nothing, please try again\")\n    print(\"Congratulation!!!

They leave their families as young teens for training, with no guarantee to be a part of any group for years. And through all this, they are subjected to mental and physical abuse, which has pushed some k-pop artists to commit suicide. The pressures of the industry and the fans in South Korea are enormous, and Asia in general is on an entirely different level. \n\nThese k-pop stars also have no say in any creative aspect of their music or performances. Every little detail and idea comes from the entertainment company. This aspect of the industry is troubling because it solidifies the idea of these kids as possessions, not people. How sad is it to pursue a music career knowing you will never be able to express yourself creatively, which is likely included in the contract they sign. \n\nLet\u2019s end it on this gem. These entertainment companies, their CEOs and even some of the actual stars, have orchestrated a prostitution ring to lure foreign investors to invest in these shit companies. Women have been drugged, raped and sexually assaulted, and in some cases filmed without their knowledge or consent. \n\nThe k-pop industry likes to project an image of glamour and perfection, but the reality is much more sinister."}, {"subreddit": "gaming", "label": 3, "post": "Found an unopened PS1 in my grandfathers attic!

This evening I completed a 500+ track [spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/1220194364/playlist/2NP00VacaPNLVBZOjBunXP) of all songs / bands mentioned in the massive [Metalheads of Reddit, what song would you show someone to prove that not all metal is insane noise and screaming?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/67x5ix/metalheads_of_reddit_what_song_would_you_show/) r/AskReddit thread by /u/Nickthenegative. The good, the bad (drowning pool, slipknot), the ugly (anal cunt (hehe)), within the limitations of spotify availability, from all posts above 7 upvotes, all parent comments and most child comments. I stopped at posts 7 and below because a lot of the posts started repeating suggestions and I got tired. If the posted track was not available due to album not being on spotify I added my favorite jammer from that band, or their top track if I wasn't familiar with them. \n\nFormatting was by basically top/highest upvoted parent comment first, then it's children, usually 2 or 3 layers down. \n\nWith this format, similar bands from subgenres are usually clumped together on the playlist. Like the highest voted post was /u/exoticcatpoopcoffee being converted to a metalhead by Animals as Leaders, and a bunch of child posts where related to Chon, Plini, etc. Then the next bunch of tracks will be a bunch of stoner metal tracks, and then a bunch of Iron Maiden and all the subsequent tracks listed in it's child comments, etc.\n\nI didn't put entire albums on the playlist, didn't want people to have to slog through a whole album if there was a jammer or two that got that albums point across, also wanted playlist to flow and have variety like the comments in the original thread did.\n\nI think this playlist is a good conversion tool for people interested in the metal genre, lots of varied styles to listen to, and if someone's not digging a track just skip ahead and you'll likely get another totally different genre that may suit you better.\n\nThe best, and definitely most underappreciated post on the thread was from /u/YeimzHetfield ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/67x5ix/metalheads_of_reddit_what_song_would_you_show/dgunrr1)) going into what I think the most chronologically appropriate metal genre journey, building on intensity and brutality. He also linked to another fantastic post about [doom metal](https://www.reddit.com/r/Metal/comments/11gcky/recently_found_doom_metal_would_love_your/c6m8le1) from /u/deathofthesun from 4 years ago, that details the highlights of the doom genre decade by decade, which I couldn't help but add to this playlist as a bonus since its now tangentially connected to the main post, and it was brutal as fuck.\n\n\nTrends I noticed were:\n\nLots of Opeth recommendations, with 12 tracks on the playlist. Which makes sense because they're a phenomenal band that's pushed the metal genre and their band in a lot of different directions, from death metal to clean vocalled progressive metal to some of their current stuff sounding almost like jazz fusion if you didn't know it was actually an Opeth record. Great for demonstrating the diversity of the genre, even from one band.\n\nLots of Iron Maiden, 11 tracks on playlist, again, not surprising, classic metal masters but not aggressive so would be easily absorbed by someone new to metal to listen to.\n\nLots of stoner (and doom/sludge) metal, which I've noticed usually does pretty well on reddit in general.\n\nA lot of Devin Townsend, which is always nice, 8 tracks including SYL. (RIP skullet)\n\nA heavy amount of Ghost, 5 tracks.\n\nA pretty good amount of Tool recommendations, none of which is on spotify. I can see how Tool can definitely be a gateway for some people to progressive metal.\n\nA heavy spoonful of Mastodon recommendations, which could be potentially controversial.\n\nSome of the most grievous suggestions I had to leave out, sadly due to spotify availability limitations:\n[Mirror Mirror by Blind Guardian](https://youtu.be/1AfNOKQdY-U), I'd recommend the entire [Nightfall on Middle Earth](https://youtu.be/hMcBOvOuhoY) album. I've used it to convert a couple fantasy nerds to appreciate metal with it because it's a concept album based on JRR Tolkien's Silmarillion, and is probably the best power metal album of all time.\n\n[Acid Bath - When the Kite String Pops](https://vimeo.com/207142719) that album isn't even uploaded to youtube currently.\n\nTool.\n\n[Boris - Heavy Rocks (2002)](https://youtu.be/UCFU1Dpfmnk)\n\nThere's several other gems, some power metal that weird record label issues,  also the more obscure NWOBHM and traditional heavy metal genres that weren't on spotify.\n\nTracks this playlist refueled a passion for, which I hadn't heard in a while: [Nightwish - Nemo](https://youtu.be/kIBdpFJyFkc) and [Powerwolf's Amen and Attack](https://youtu.be/KmqgRAXygDg). Highlights of bands I'm really digging that this playlist introduced me to or got me to dig further into: Sabaton and Edguy (I hadn't really listened to them before this playlist, great shit though). Satan (NWOBHM band, pretty awesome). Jeff Loomis, holy fucking shit. \n\n\nMy contribution to the playlist which I didn't see anyone else mention was [\"I Was Buried At Mount Pleasant Cemetery\"](https://youtu.be/T9TvcAMENJE) by Woods of Ypres, it's beautiful. And Uriah Heep, thanks ma.\n\nSome bands that have converted friends of mine to become metalheads are Blind Guardian (as mentioned above, for the fantasy friend). I have a history buff friend that said he liked Dethklok a lot, and I told him that music is mimicking / riffing actual bands, so I gave him a good array of metal, and what hooked him was Amon Amarth, and he got super into the viking metal genre and now knows way more viking metal than I do. I have another bud who saw Alestorm randomly at a festival and really liked them a lot, blam, pirate metal. I got my brother into metal with Opeth and the Death Clock Armageddon album by Dimmu Borgir (fun fact: Nathan Explosion used to work at Dimmu Burger). Even my wife, who usually gets a headache from metal, really likes new Opeth a lot. \n\nWhat got me into metal was my parents spoonfeeding me progressive rock from a very young age, and also I went through a phase in very late elementary/early middle school were I got obsessed with classical music (which /u/Rajajones recommended in his insightful [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/67x5ix/metalheads_of_reddit_what_song_would_you_show/dguhflr) as well with a [Beethoven's 7th Symphony](https://youtu.be/Fjm4AZn2VBE) recommendation). But this all led me down a road to metal, for years I sought brutality before I know what metal even was. I also think seeing [Cannibal Corpse in Ace Ventura Pet Detective](https://youtu.be/xjiCh88q4kA) also helped.\n\nSo the moral of the story is there's metal for everyone out there, you just have to open up your heart and let the grim hails fill you in just the right places.\n\n[Here it is](https://open.spotify.com/user/1220194364/playlist/2NP00VacaPNLVBZOjBunXP), hope yall enjoy it, it was really fun making it. \\m/\n\nEdit: Several formatting edits and link additions.

I did that last week with *[The Life Changing Art of Tidying Up](https://archive.org/details/Marie.Kondo..The.LifeChanging.Magic.of.Tidying.Up..audiobook..004)*\n\nIt's a book related to discarding excess of material things from life and thus living a life that is more clear and fulfilling, which in my opinion is Minimalism. I recently took up Minimalism and so I wanted to check this book out. I heard a lot about this book in the last few months.\n\nBut by the time I was half way through it, it got so annoying that I just couldn't take it anymore.\n\nThere are actually two reasons why I quit this book:\n\n1. The book starts by author telling (rather insisting) that hers is the *only way* to follow minimalism. (I tend to have trouble with anything that says their way is the only way to do something.)\n\n2. The tone of the narrator was so annoying, she always had that overreaching self-centered pride in almost every single sentence.\n\nCombine these both and it was a real irritating experience to listen to this book. So, I told myself: *fuck it,* and scrapped the folder from my phone.\n\nDid any of you ever had this sort of experience with an audiobook before?\n\n**EDIT:** I really hope and pray that the audiobook producers and voice actors out there come across our discussion here so that they get a greater awareness on our concerns, and work towards providing better quality audiobooks for us all.

As usual, I would always rather stay and spend my time connecting with you here, however, my campaign manager is telling me it's time to do other things. Please check out my website and social media pages, I look forward to talking with you there!\n\nI am a life-long activist, political organizer, small business owner and mother living in Hallowell, Maine. I am a progressive Democrat running for U.S. Senate, seeking to unseat Republican incumbent Susan Collins. \n\nMainers and all Americans deserve leaders who will put people before party and profit. I am not taking a dime of corporate or dark money during this campaign.

I ran as a Clean Elections candidate for governor in 2018 -- the only Democratic candidate in the race to do so. I have pledged to refuse all corporate PAC and dirty money in this race, and I fuel my campaign with small-dollar donations and a growing grassroots network of everyday Mainers. \n\nMy nearly 40 years of advocacy accomplishments include:\n\n* Writing and helping pass the first Family Medical Leave Act in the country\n\n* Creating the first Clean Elections system in the country\n\n* Working on every Maine State Budget for 37 years\n\n* Serving as executive director of the Maine Women\u2019s Lobby\n\n* Serving as program coordinator for the Women\u2019s International League for Peace and Freedom\n\n* Serving as Commissioner for Women under Governors Brennan and McKernan\n\n* Co-founding the Maine Center for Economic Policy and the Dirigo Alliance\nFounding and running my own small advocacy business, Moose Ridge Associates.\n\n* Co-founding the Civil Rights Team Project, an anti-bullying program currently taught in 400 schools across the state. \n\n* I am also a trainer of sexual harassment prevention for businesses, agencies and schools. \n\nI am proud to have the endorsements of Justice Democrats, Brand New Congress, Democracy For America, Progressive Democrats for America, Women for Justice - Northeast, Blue America and Forward Thinking Democracy. \n\n**Check out my website and social media:**\n\n* https://betsysweet.com\n\n* Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/betsysweetME)\n\n* Instagram (https://www.instagram.com/betsysweetme/) \n\n* Twitter (https://twitter.com/BetsySweetME)\n\n* Youtube (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQmK7as5-nWW3_khgQtiLyQ) \n\nImage: https://i.imgur.com/19dgPzv.jpg"}, {"subreddit": "politics", "label": 7, "post": "Megathread: Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene (GA-14) Stripped of House Committee Assignments Today, the House voted to strip Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene (GA-14) from her committee assignments on the House Education Committee and House Budget Committee.

If anyone could give me an explanation, that would be nice.\n\nAlso, my thoughts on the book are that it was alright. Nothing really special, didn't really have anything to say, I'm sure it was more controversial when it first came out.\n\nAlso also, I'm an aussie, so it might just be an american thing I don't understand.\n\nEdit: HOLY MOTHER MARY'S KNICKERS!

I actually wanted to adress the questions yis all had for me. \n\n1. I DON'T HATE THE BOOK! Jesus Christ a lot of you got the impression that I hated this book. I DO NOT! I merely just think that it's not special. It's somewhat of s good book, but just not a masterpiece. \n\n2. I was 17 when I read the book. So you can't really say I was too old or anything when I read it. I will pick it up when I'm older, but stop using this argument please.\n\n3. A lot of people were saying that I needed to know the context of when it was released. Well I do know that context, but it doesn't matter. I wanted to know why people TODAY thought it was a masterpiece. I have no doubt that it was very controversial for it's time. But it's not the 1950s anymore. Because that today it's nothing more than a young adult novel. \n\n4. Also some people were asking if I ever suffered from mental illness. All I will say is that I have attempted suicide on multiple occasions before. \n\nIn conclusion, I don't hate the book, it's enjoyable enough, just not a masterpiece. Also stop commenting please, my phone is literally blowing up. \n\nG'night."}, {"subreddit": "entertainment", "label": 0, "post": "John Krasinski Surprises Boston Health Care Workers With Red Sox Tickets for Life "}, {"subreddit": "travel", "label": 9, "post": "My bubble hotel room in Petra, Jordan.

I was hiding in various parts of this huge backyard for probably 5 hours, hearing my friends get picked off one at a time in little bouts of screaming, barking, and of course the lovely cops screaming the \u201chard R\u201d at my friends. I managed to get out of the neighborhood, ran like 3 miles, and started hitchhiking, when my boy who was at the house calls me. I pick it up and its a cop saying \u201cHi Matthew, your friend ratted you out and we know your name and address. We aren\u2019t gonna stop looking for you.\u201d (it was the kid i didn\u2019t know that snitched, not any of my friends) So I gave up and told him where I was. I\u2019m standing in the middle of the road with my hands up, and this cop has the audacity to jump out of his car with his gun out screaming \u201cget on the ground you f-ing yankee\u201d and shoves my face into the street while handcuffing me. they put me in a separate cell from all the other kids and wouldn\u2019t stop calling me Yankee lol it felt like it was the 1800s or something. I got charged with 2 counts of burglary, 2 counts of criminal trespassing, and felonies for xan and wax. Luckily i got a good lawyer and wasn\u2019t actually guilty of any of those things, so i ended up with 2 misdemeanors - criminal trespassing and underage drinking. I talked about it in more detail in this [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuRF8F0ruM&t=38s).\n\nthe second arrest was for breaking into a tire store in Buckhead, because this kid i met at a bar told me his dad owned it and i was too drunk to think twice when he forced open the door with a shovel.\n\nthat first arrest was the reason for the probation experience i mentioned in 1 thot 2 thot. i had to do 240 hours of community service, so i moved in with my friend who owns a thrift shop in Montana to finesse some extra hours / get away from my bad influence friends in Minnesota. I worked 10 hours every single day for 24 days straight. The last day when i got off i was so hyped i went home and wrote 1 thot 2 thot in like 30 minutes. got a bottle of cognac and went to the studio that night (: GRAVY OFF PROBATION\n\np.s. jail in iowa is way better than jail in georgia\""}, {"subreddit": "technology", "label": 5, "post": "Eight members of Congress that voted to kill broadband privacy are now leading the charge to kill Net Neutrality as well FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai is advancing a plan to kill net neutrality and let ISPs like Comcast and Verizon slow down or censor websites and apps. His plan would make the Internet slower and more expensive, and it would make censorship for profit the norm. \n \nWe can stop this like we stopped SOPA, TPP, and ACTA. We just need to make it clear that Pai\u2019s plan is **toxic** so that no one in Washington wants anything to do with it. \n \nHere\u2019s what we can do. There are 8 members of Congress currently egging the FCC on and helping Pai gut net neutrality. They recently put their names on a [statement of support](https://energycommerce.house.gov/news-center/press-releases/bicameral-leaders-comment-pai-s-internet-regulations-announcement) or expressed their support in a [document of anti-net neutrality talking points](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3728775-GOP-Member-Toolkit-FCC-Open-Internet-Order-5-2017.html) to show that Pai has some congressional backing.  \n \nThey\u2019re hoping we don\u2019t notice and that they won\u2019t face a backlash, so we need to call out these members of Congress now to make sure other members of Congress stay away. That way we can starve Pai of the congressional backing he needs to push through his plan.\n \nHere are the 8 members of Congress that are publicly supporting Pai\u2019s attack on net neutrality:\n \n* Rep. Greg Walden (R-OR)  (Twitter: [@RepGregWalden](https://twitter.com/repgregwalden); phone: 202-225-6730)\n* Rep.

(Note: Paul Ryan did not formally vote on the broadband privacy bill because, by custom, the Speaker of the House does not vote on legislation unless their vote would be decisive. But, as Speaker, Ryan was responsible for bringing the bill to the floor to be voted on.)\n \n**Call their offices, tweet at them, post on their Facebook walls. Tell them you are appalled by their support for Ajit Pai\u2019s plan to kill net neutrality and that you will do everything in your power to hold them accountable for destroying the Internet.** \n \nWe can\u2019t let these members of Congress get away with supporting Pai\u2019s plan, or else other members of Congress will think it\u2019s safe to support it as well. We know the cable lobbyists are trying their best to get everyone in Congress to support Pai\u2019s plan. It\u2019s up to us to stand up and make them think twice before they mess with the Internet.\n\nEDIT: [u/pperca rightly points out](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6e8wta/eight_members_of_congress_that_voted_to_kill/di8hxda/) that another 8 senators have co-sponsored a bill that would repeal net neutrality. While their bill isn\u2019t an explicit endorsement of Pai\u2019s plan at the FCC, it\u2019s basically a thinly veiled way of supporting Pai, so they deserve to be called out too. \n \n* Sen.

He tasked me with helping him generate the data using Excel and advanced SQL logic.\n\nI decided to dust off my rusty Python scripting knowledge and created a script that automated the entire process. It took many hours, a lot of googling and 2 mugs of coffee, but I accomplished what I set out to do. My script was able to generate nearly 5000 queries in less than a minute.\n\nNeedless to say, my boss was impressed by my initiative, and I've found out first hand how useful knowing Python is.

Needless to say, over the past few months, I've been assigned many different tasks on both the business and engineering side, learning a lot in the process that will be invaluable to my career in the future.\n\nRegarding an increase in pay, I've put in the paperwork to go full time, and I gained his approval a few weeks back because of how much effort I put in to making sure I completed my tasks to the best of my abilities. I think this ensured that he would back me up 100% if anyone tried to object. Hopefully by the beginning of October, I'll be billing for 40 hours instead of 24.\n\nI love the team and company I work for, as everyone is super friendly and willing to help me out. Also, part of the reason I automated this task was because it helps my boss politically. I'm not too well-versed in office politics, but he's been giving me lessons on how to handle it. By being able to provide thousands of data points for the business team, he now has them on the back foot and they have to work hard to fulfill their end of the testing, otherwise they're going to be the ones with egg on their face if the issue gets escalated to the executive levels.\n\nI only had two mugs of coffee because my mom yelled at me for drinking coffee late at night and banned me from the kitchen. :D\n\n&#x200B;"}, {"subreddit": "politics", "label": 7, "post": "While Constantly Yelling About Voter Fraud, Trump Tried To Register In FL With WH Address "}, {"subreddit": "python", "label": 1, "post": "Monitor your internet with python "}, {"subreddit": "politics", "label": 7, "post": "Debates commission plans to cut off mics if Trump or Biden break rules "}, {"subreddit": "gaming", "label": 3, "post": "Don\u2019t be a Hippo-crit "}, {"subreddit": "books", "label": 4, "post": "She was shot dead by the Nazis in 1942.

I'm not super experienced in Python \\-\\- my main programming language is Java, but I learned Python from a CS course I took last semester.  I love programming, but I also really love hip hop music.  I typically find this music by looking at a website called Hot New Hip Hop, which keeps a list of the top 100 new songs at any given time.  There are a select number of artists who I like, and a lot of the time the tracks are too new to be on Spotify.\n\nTo save myself time, I automated my process of searching for and discovering new music.  I used Windows Task Scheduler to schedule a script to run every morning, scrape the top 100 songs page, and add songs to a playlist if they're made by artists I like and are on Spotify.  I also used a SQLite database to store my Spotify client and access tokens, as well as prevent adding duplicate songs.  This script will probably save me about 45 minutes to an hour each week, which is pretty sweet.

It was funny as fuck and gross at the same time.\"\n\n> Oh, that's Dre with an AK to his face\nDon't make me kill him too\nAnd spray his brains all over the place\nI told you, Dre, you should've kept that thang put away\nI guess that'll teach you not to let me play with it, eh?\n\nEminem: \"This is my 5th attempt at trying to kill Dre. I\u2019m kinda surprised he still wants to be my friend.\"\n\n>Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit\nI'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe\n\nEminem: \"Every time I have had a court issue since this line, I\u2019ve been asked to provide the wardrobe for my legal team.

I have an internship with Amazon for the summer, but it with the Data Center Operations divisions. So working with servers mostly. But I found a way to make an impression on my manager today using Python. I can't go into specific details of what we were working on (NDA and confidentiality and all) but I can talk about what I did. \n\nWe were working with a large number of assets (327 total) and part of that work involved compiling information about those assets. Well as an intern I get all the crap jobs. So I got handed that job. So for 2 days, I've been working on compiling the info in a spreadsheet. Thought I was finished but found I only had information for 319 assets. Well, we can't just 'lose' 8 assets. That kind of looks bad on a record. So my manager wanted me to go through the list of total assets and figure out what 8 we didn't have info for. I'm like 99% sure he was expecting me to go line by line in excel and do a CTRL+F to see which ones from the total list weren't on the info list. A nice little process that would likely have taken me the better part of the day to accomplish.   \n\nInstead, I pulled up python, threw together a script to build 2 lists (one for total assets, one for the information I had compiled) and then compare the lists. Anything it found in the totals list that it didn't find in the info list got dumped to a text file.  \n\nTotal time: 18 minutes (I had to look up some info on the xlswriter module).  \n\nMy manager literally said: \"How the hell did you do that?\" when I showed him the list 20 minutes after we spoke."}, {"subreddit": "sports", "label": 8, "post": "Edson Barboza KOs Beneil Dariush with a perfectly timed flying knee at UFC Fight Night 106 "}, {"subreddit": "python", "label": 1, "post": "Voice Cloning App Hi everyone,\n\nOver the past year, I've been getting into voice synthesis and I've realised there are a lot of obstacles for newcomers.\n\nTo make voice cloning easier I've developed a new app using 100% python/pytorch which can be found here: [https://github.com/BenAAndrew/Voice-Cloning-App](https://github.com/BenAAndrew/Voice-Cloning-App)\n\nThis app allows you to take an audiobook of anyone and build a TTS tool of their voice.\n\nAlongside the app, I've published a youtube series and sharing app where you can listen to audio samples (such as David Attenborough) and share voices with the community (links in the Github).\n\nThe project has been going really well and I'm working on the project round the clock to make it as useful as possible.

Dialogue floored me. The *story* floored me. I don\u2019t give a singular shit if the historical accuracy isn\u2019t there; I\u2019m an American and I read this strictly as fiction. In my eyes, the people who write off this book because they disagree with King\u2019s interpretation of the assassination are fools.\n\nAnd dear God, that ending. Yeah, I\u2019m a guy who sheds tears a lot\u2014I mean a *lot*\u2014while reading or watching. Just recently, I probably cried during like 3 or 4 movies. And during this book, my cheeks were soaked during the performance of *Of Mice and Men.* It was such a heartwarming and simultaneously heartbreaking moment. Maybe I\u2019m wrong, but I also saw it as a little foreshadowing for this ending. Now, for the ending itself. I didn\u2019t cry at all. I have no idea why. The opposite of George, I was dry-eyed in those final pages but not so during the rest of the book. It was so weird, I can\u2019t explain it, especially considering that the ending was incredibly heartbreaking and should bring anyone who resonated with this story to tears.\n\nThis is the best book I\u2019ve ever read. Now that I\u2019m finished with it\u2014it\u2019s the morning after\u2014I have no idea where to go next. I know I\u2019m going to read another one of King\u2019s books, but just the thought that there won\u2019t be another chance for Sadie and George will haunt me for a while, I think.\n\nThanks for reading my rant."}, {"subreddit": "entertainment", "label": 0, "post": "American Psycho director Mary Harron: \u201cWe\u2019ve never really left\u201d the era of Patrick Bateman "}, {"subreddit": "python", "label": 1, "post": "pip_irl "}, {"subreddit": "travel", "label": 9, "post": "You *can* travel with kids - Railey Beach, Thailand, 2015 "}, {"subreddit": "politics", "label": 7, "post": "'A Conspiracy to Steal the Election, Folks': Alarms Sound After Postal Worker Reports Removal of Sorting Machines.

I took that to an extreme and condensed that into a calculator that is a single expression in Python.\n\nNotice that a single expression and a single line aren't the same thing, expressions are even smaller parts. A single line can contain multiple expressions and statements. An expression can't contain any of that.\n\nHere is what we started with:\n\n    from tkinter import *\n    \n    def bt_draw(key, col, lin):\n        bt = Button(window, text=key, command=lambda: bt_press(key))\n        bt.grid(column=col+1, row=lin+1)\n        return bt\n    \n    def bt_press(key):\n        if   key == \"C\": disp[\"text\"] = \"\"\n        elif key == \"<\": disp[\"text\"] = disp[\"text\"][:-1]\n        elif key == \"=\": disp[\"text\"] = str(round(eval(disp[\"text\"]), 6))\n        else           : disp[\"text\"] += key\n    \n    window = Tk()\n    window.title(\"TKalc\")\n    \n    disp = Label(window, text=\"\")\n    print(disp.grid(column=0, row=0, columnspan=5))\n    \n    keys = \"()C<789/456*123-.0=+\"\n    bt_list = [bt_draw(keys[n], n%4, n//4) for n in range(20)]\n    \n    window.mainloop()\n\nHere is the final code:\n\n    (tk := __import__(\"tkinter\")) and (bt_draw := lambda k, c, l: (bt := tk.Button(w, text=k, command=lambda: bt_press(k), width=6)) and bt.grid(column=c, row=l) or bt) and (update := lambda t: d.config(text=t)) and (bt_press := lambda k: update(\"\") if k == \"C\" else update(d[\"text\"][:-1]) if k == \"<\" else update(str(round(eval(d[\"text\"]), 6))) if k == \"=\" else update(d[\"text\"] + k)) and (w := tk.Tk()) and w.title(\"TKalc\") or (d := tk.Label(w, text=\"\")) and d.grid(column=0, row=0, columnspan=5) or [bt_draw(k, n%4 + 1, n//4 + 1) for n, k in enumerate(\"()C<789/456*123-.0=+\")] and w.mainloop()\n\n[GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/RojerGS/3b3d301710da3da80ece693de068e3c9)\n\n**Here is how I did it:**\n\nFirst things first, we clean up the code a bit:\n\n* starred imports aren't generally a good idea and we only need 3 things, so import those or import `tkinter` by itself;\n* the list comprehension in the end should really use an `enumerate` ([writing Pythonic code with `enumerate`](https://mathspp.com/blog/pydonts/enumerate-me));\n* it doesn't make much sense to increment the row and column of the buttons when creating them, the `bt_draw` function should be called with the correct arguments;\n* we add some width to the buttons when we create them, otherwise the calculator looks *really* bad (might be because of my operating system).\n\nWe get this:\n\n    import tkinter as tk\n    \n    def bt_draw(key, col, lin):\n        bt = tk.Button(window, text=key, command=lambda: bt_press(key), width=5)\n        bt.grid(column=col, row=lin)\n        return bt\n    \n    def bt_press(key):\n        if   key == \"C\": disp[\"text\"] = \"\"\n        elif key == \"<\": disp[\"text\"] = disp[\"text\"][:-1]\n        elif key == \"=\": disp[\"text\"] = str(round(eval(disp[\"text\"]), 6))\n        else           : disp[\"text\"] += key\n    \n    window = tk.Tk()\n    window.title(\"TKalc\")\n    \n    disp = tk.Label(window, text=\"\")\n    disp.grid(column=0, row=0, columnspan=5)\n    \n    keys = \"()C<789/456*123-.0=+\"\n    bt_list = [bt_draw(k, n%4 + 1, n//4 + 1) for n, k in enumerate(keys)]\n    \n    window.mainloop()\n\nNow on to rewriting everything as a single expression. First I rewrote the functions as lambdas, which means right from the start that I have to use [Boolean short-circuiting](https://mathspp.com/blog/pydonts/boolean-short-circuiting) to be able to stuff different expressions together.\n\nThe first function was:\n\n    def bt_draw(key, col, lin):\n        bt = Button(window, text=key, command=lambda: bt_press(key), width=5)\n        bt.grid(column=col+1, row=lin+1)\n        return bt\n\nand became\n\n    bt_draw = lambda k, c, l: (bt := Button(w, text=k, command=lambda: bt_press(k), width=5)) and bt.grid(column=col, row=lin)\n\nNotice that assignments are statements, not expressions, so we need to use [assignment expressions with the walrus operator](https://mathspp.com/blog/pydonts/assignment-expressions-and-the-walrus-operator) if we want to inline assignments. We don't really need to return the button for any reason, so we can just ignore the `return bt` statement, otherwise we would end our lambda with `or bt`.\n\nThe second function is a little bit more work because the `if`\\-`elif` statements need to be rewritten as conditional expressions. On top of that, `disp[\"text\"]` can't be the left-hand side of an assignment expression, so we need to work this out in some other way... just call the `config` function!\n\nWe go from\n\n    def bt_press(key):\n        if   key == \"C\": disp[\"text\"] = \"\"\n        elif key == \"<\": disp[\"text\"] = disp[\"text\"][:-1]\n        elif key == \"=\": disp[\"text\"] = str(round(eval(disp[\"text\"]), 6))\n        else           : disp[\"text\"] += key\n\nto\n\n    update = lambda t: d.config(text=t)\n    bt_press = lambda k: update(\"\") if k == \"C\" else update(d[\"text\"][:-1]) if k == \"<\" else update(str(round(eval(d[\"text\"]), 6))) if k == \"=\" else update(d[\"text\"] + k)\n\nNotice that we also factored out the \"update\" part of the logic into a single function, to separate concerns. If we later change how text is displayed, it becomes more manageable to also update the way in which we update the text, we just need to fix the `update` function.\n\nAt this point, this is the program:\n\n    import tkinter as tk\n    bt_draw = lambda k, c, l: (bt := tk.Button(w, text=k, command=lambda: bt_press(k), width=5)) and bt.grid(column=c, row=l)\n    update = lambda t: d.config(text=t)\n    bt_press = lambda k: update(\"\") if k == \"C\" else update(d[\"text\"][:-1]) if k == \"<\" else update(str(round(eval(d[\"text\"]), 6))) if k == \"=\" else update(d[\"text\"] + k)\n    w = tk.Tk()\n    w.title(\"TKalc\")\n    d = tk.Label(w, text=\"\")\n    d.grid(column=0, row=0, columnspan=5)\n    keys = \"()C<789/456*123-.0=+\"\n    bt_list = [bt_draw(k, n%4 + 1, n//4 + 1) for n, k in enumerate(keys)]\n    w.mainloop()\n\nThe final hassle is the `tkinter` import, because we are currently using an import *statement*... However, we can easily fix that with the `__import__` built-in:\n\n    tk = __import__(\"tkinter\")\n\nNow we just chain everything together in a single expression with `and`s and `or`s. All the assignments are changed into `:=` and chained together with `and`s. After calls to functions that don't return anything, for example the `.grid()` methods, we use `or`s to keep the program going."}, {"subreddit": "python", "label": 1, "post": "Skribbl.io bot in python (simulate mouse inputs) "}, {"subreddit": "technology", "label": 5, "post": "Comcast\u2019s Corporate response to my recent Reddit front page post (\u201cComcast\u2019s Notorious Unreturned Equipment Fees\u201d) sends clear message: Comcast does not give a sh*t about customers \u2013 unless your story goes national. *Before I can even begin to justify the very charged title of this post, I beg of you to please bear with me and allow me to share the entire context of what has transpired.*\n\nI am Dann Furia, OP of [Comcast\u2019s Notorious Unreturned Equipment Fees]( http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2dibwq/in_order_to_avoid_comcasts_notorious_unreturned/) which made the top spot on Reddit\u2019s front page four days ago, highlighting a common Comcast phenomenon: customers getting repeatedly billed for \u201cUnreturned\u201d equipment and other fees.\n\n**The purpose of this post is two-fold:**\n\n* Share my (previously untold on Reddit) entire Comcast story\n* Address Comcast\u2019s response to my recent front page Reddit post about Comcast\u2019s fees\n\n\n**Part I - MY ENTIRE COMCAST STORY**\n\n**During the six month period from mid-January of 2014 through the end of July of 2014, I had to contact Comcast an astounding 25 times in regards to a multitude of issues, errors, and mistakes with my service, and charges related to my Comcast account.**  I kept careful, written records of my experiences as far back as January of this year, and by early July I had experienced such a stupefying range of problems with Comcast, that I additionally began recording my interactions with them.\n\nDuring the above-referenced six month period, Comcast was a thoroughly disconcerting 0 for 25 in resolving anything.  Now, I completely understand that it may seem rather farfetched for me to claim that a single company (even one as notorious as Comcast) could fail the same customer 25 consecutive times, that is until you consider that I have previously documented at length each of [25 Consecutive Failed Comcast Interactions here in a four page Comcast blog] (http://www.dannfuria.com/comcast) spanning 6 months, 17 phone calls, 6 appointments, 2 online interactions, 20+ hours of my personal time, and $1320 in fees) and further that I possess months of paperwork, 50+ pages of documents, files, images, bills, screen shots, phone records, and roughly two hours of audio recordings, to support my claims.  While my four page Comcast blog may not be the most exhilarating read, the entirety of the account - the sum of its parts, if you will - is in my opinion a damning indictment of Comcast customer handling.  At a minimum, my four page Comcast blog provides another well documented account of a relentlessly awful brand of service.\n\n\n**Part 2 - COMCAST\u2019S RESPONSE TO MY FRONT PAGE REDDIT POST ABOUT COMCAST\u2019S NOTORIOUS FEES**\n\nAs noted above, I tried in earnest 25 times in a six month period from January through July of 2014 to get Comcast to help me.  Comcast steadfastly ignored, neglected, dodged, and billed the crap out of me.  Put more poignantly, Comcast played an incredibly effective game of \u201cAnnoying you out of your money, wearing you down until you're too weak to complain, and then when you just can't go on, charge you for early cancellation. Or just make something up and put it on a bill and hope no one notices.\" (Bill Maher, 7/25/14).\n\nThen, *after* my [Comcast\u2019s Notorious Unreturned Equipment Fees]( http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2dibwq/in_order_to_avoid_comcasts_notorious_unreturned/) post topped the Reddit front page four days ago and my story received national attention, Comcast\u2019s Corporate office left me 5 messages in 18 hours.  I repeat - not a SINGLE Comcast employee could bother to help me one time in 6 months, despite my 25 well documented attempts to get help, and now all of the sudden Comcast has the ability to contact me 5 times in 18 hours?  That is interesting.\n\nWhen I listened to the first voicemail from Comcast Corporate, I felt relieved that someone might actually finally help me.  But by the time I made my way through five consecutive Comcast Corporate messages (4 of them from the same person), and realized that they had all been delivered in an 18 hour period directly after my \u201cComcast fees\u201d post went Reddit-viral, I literally began to feel sick to my stomach by Comcast\u2019s response.  Now, I understand that when a Comcast customer story like mine starts to get national attention, Comcast probably tries to minimize whatever gripes might publicly emerge.  I also concede \u2013 flat out \u2013 a measure of hypocrisy on my part for reacting partly in anger that Comcast finally responded to me.  Having said that, there could not possibly be a more poignant, scathing illustration of the contrast between Comcast\u2019s treatment of a regular customer (contemptuously disregarded 25 times in 6 months) and a \u201cSpecial / Going Public\u201d customer (5 Corporate messages in 18 hours).\n\nAll indications are that Comcast has just now (as of about 3 days ago) taken notice of a customer - who for several years has resided in their backyard, the suburbs of Philadelphia \u2013 and begun to address but one of many unfortunate aspects of my Comcast experience (the $1320 in fees aspect).  I, meanwhile, have had 7 months to bake in the rancor of Comcast Purgatory, a dimension from which very few, if any, escape.  So please allow me, indulge me if you would be so kind, to summarize how this feels from my perspective:  In a six month period this year, Comcast mishandled my account 25 times in a row, put me on hold on the phone for several hours, failed to show up to multiple appointments, hung up on me while I was on hold, fed me a torrent of misinformation (much of which is recorded on audio, mine and theirs), threatened me with and then auto-generated to my account a Literally-Unremovable $960 Termination Fee, repeatedly billed me $360 for properly returning my equipment, and wasted way more than 20 hours of my time.\n\nComcast\u2019s effective response in helping me during the six month time frame? Zero. Zilch. None. Null. Devoid.\nComcast\u2019s response when I cancelled my account?  They buried me $1320 in fees.\nComcast\u2019s response when I went public to complain?  Their Corporate office immediately contacted me 5 times in 18 hours.\n\n**And so this appears to be the standard for receiving attention from a Comcast representative who actually has the ability or power to address problems that Comcast has caused a customer:** First, a customer should suffer through months of negligence and poor treatment, documenting each step of the journey while firmly battling a motley assortment of heinous fees, then after 6 months utterly give up all hope and feel like a fool for bothering to try so hard to get Comcast to help you, then \u2013 if you can manage to find the time - write a [4 page blog about your Comcast experience](http://www.dannfuria.com/comcast), then [share part of your story with Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2dibwq/in_order_to_avoid_comcasts_notorious_unreturned/), be fortunate enough to receive incredible & overwhelming support that vaults your post to the Reddit front page, and gain some national coverage (from The Verge, Gawker, & International Business Times).  Perhaps then - and only then - can a customer get Comcast to clean up a mess they\u2019ve created.\n\nIt appears, for the time being, that I might just escape from Comcastic Purgatory.  \n\nBut believe me when I say this with heartfelt sincerity: I feel genuinely sorry for the rest of you poor souls."}, {"subreddit": "travel", "label": 9, "post": "Taken on a 1st gen iPhone in Kauai almost a decade ago, still my favorite travel photo "}, {"subreddit": "python", "label": 1, "post": "Why is python so much slower on MacOS?

This app is atrociously bad for performance, it  spreads to all of your system (and I mean ALL of your system), and the developers intentionally made it hard for you to remove it. I made the mistake of installing it when I was trying out Spyder IDE. I didn't realize this app installed itself across all of my editors, including neovim. I started noticing that my neovim would get several seconds of hiccup when I was running  python REPL, which had never happened before. Soon my Linux system started experiencing severe hiccup as well. Then I did some profiling and found out that Kite was making background process calls without my consent. The  worst part yet is they made it nearly impossible for you uninstall it, not unless you download their shady app manager or make a curl call to a completely unknown api server just to uninstall apps on your computer. I don't even want to know what kind of personal information / data that they were stealing from my computer. I fail to see how Kite is different from a virus. Please use extra caution when going through IDE setup as something like Kite can easily creep in and contaminate your whole system just like that. To the developers of Spyder and VSCode and other IDEs, please take active step in banning an app like Kite that severely infringes upon the privacy and right of their users. By promoting this app as an extension, you are potentially endangering millions of your users!\n\nEDIT on 9/13/2021:\n\nI wanted to attach my comment response to juliusc (maintainer of Spyder) to the main post, as it echoes my core concerns. I want to thank juliusc for responding to this post.\n\n**Hi juliusc,**\n\n**First of all, I want to thank you for engaging this post and responding to my concerns. I took some time to collect my thoughts and just wanted to share them with you and other developers of popular development tools like Spyder, VSCode, Atom etc. By no means am I trying to single out Spyder, and I want you to know that I deeply appreciate all the work that you guys have done to empower everyone by democratizing better development tools.**\n\n**I would like to point out though, that there was nothing \"light\" about the promotion of Kite in Spyder. As me and other users have noted, Kite installation during the initialization setup of Spyder was an opt-out by default. I am sure many people either clicked through the setup and installed Kite without reading the \"fine-prints\" as is totally reasonable for an average user, and/or they mistakenly assumed that Kite is a safe and secure plugin that had been vetted by the Spyder developers, as it's one of the first things that you see when you start using Spyder. Without sounding accusatory, I was very disappointed that the Spyder developers allowed this to happen. Since I haven't been monitoring your git tracker issues related to Kite (because frankly it's not my job), I will take your word for it that not many Spyder users raised my concern. But anyone who just googles Kite will quickly discover that Kite had severe security/privacy concerns, was an invasive software, and its company conducted extremely questionable business practices in other open source packages as far back as 2017. In fact, the very same announcement post of Kite's sponsorship of Spyder in 2019 already had several users that raised their concerns in the comments section (**[**https://www.spyder-ide.org/blog/spyder-kite-funding/**](https://www.spyder-ide.org/blog/spyder-kite-funding/)**). I don't think it's fair to say that well since the users didn't find any issue and complained about them on git, then we will let it slide. I get that you guys are maintaining/developing Spyder for all of us for free, but I also uphold you to a higher standard because a single bad commit or decision by you can lead to disproportional effects on the rest of us. And sometimes these effects take a while for us to find out and may have irreversible and disastrous consequences. I truly beseech you to be truthful with us and with yourselves, whether if corporate sponsorship, financial or otherwise, means that you can lower the standard that you hold for software integration, even if it comes at the cost of your users. Because if that is the case, then it's a slippery slope to the end of free and open source development as we know it.**\n\n**Okay, enough of a long rant.

Ok. I know that this post is going to be downvoted to hell, although I never understood why people downvote a post that has a different opinion to theirs, but I will say it anyways.. Reading DUNE did not turn out the way I thought it would.\n \nI liked science fiction ideas in general ever since I was a kid. It was mostly due to the influence of films and thriller novels with light sci-fi plot lines with the exception of Andy Weir's *The Martian* which I loved. But I wanted to pick up some classic sci-fi works for quite some time.\n\nSo, this year, I decided to give DUNE a go as I wanted to read this novel before watching the movie that was supposed to come out this December. I started the novel in August. \n\nIt was going fine until the first couple of hundred pages, but soon the reading experience turned into a tough one. The world building was too complex, and the descriptions seemed to be too much.. of things, traditions, cultures, and whatnot. Additionally, I was having trouble creating the mental images of a lot of things.. example: all the equipment and machinery used on Arrakis.\n\nI don't know if this is how all epic sci-fi is written or if this is specific to particular works but the plot felt to be moving either far too slowly or moving in far too uninteresting way. I think the latter. It was never really exciting to me the journey of Paul and Jessica across the desert and how they get adopted into the Fremen clan.. and the Fremen rituals of Holy Mother and etc...\n\nUnfortunately, none of the things in the book made it a page-turner to me. I gave long break between readings. It took me months to finish this book. But I have to mention that I was reading the new paperback edition. I regretted not going for a kindle edition. That could also be a reason why I read it far too slowly.\n\nI also couldn't connect emotionally to any characters in the book which is strange as there are SO MANY characters. The villain seemed too typical and there are specific plot points that made no sense to me.\n\nOverall, I was quite disappointed that I couldn't enjoy it more. I came to DUNE with different expectations and minimal reading experience in hardcore science fiction literature which I believe to also be contributing to how I'm feeling about this novel. I was left fully exhausted by the end and didn't pickup another novel for this month.\n\n**EDIT**: *Amazed at the response and support I got here and very happy that I was proven wrong by you all who upheld a fellow reader's genuine opinion. Thank you all very much.*"}, {"subreddit": "science", "label": 2, "post": "The use of jargon kills people\u2019s interest in science, politics.

It's even worse when they say it mockingly.\n\nFrom time to time I try to intervene and say something in the lines of \"hey, I happened to have read this book with my little sister, and I found it really good\" to try to convince the parents to let the kid read the book, but I don't do that too often because no one likes strangers bringing in their unsolicited opinions. \n\nI started reading when I was 11, and it was the diary of a wimpy kid.

I happened to find the book cover interesting and was immediately hooked in in the first sentences. It was funny and easy to read. Five years later I was reading the picture of dorian gray in english even though it was my third language.\n\nEverytime we see a kid with a book, we should let them know they're doing good. I would say there are exceptions, but those refer just to objectively bad books. Outside of that, there aren't many bad books, *especially* for kids.

I couldn't ever understand it reading it all in a week. Every few pages gives me enough to think about. \n\nI explained to them that cellphones and social media and the like also contain letters and that this constitutes \"reading material\". The owners response was \"I don't want to ban cellphones\" and the General Manager added \"it is against corporate rules\". As in, cellphones are also banned. So to them cellphones are OK but a book is not. \n\nI attempted to explain I'm missing the fillings out of some of my teeth due to root canals and me not having the money to replace them. I have to chew with my front teeth (mostly) and I can use my normal masticating teeth very carefully and deliberately. It takes me a lot longer (relatively) to chew food than most people.

I bitched about having to do all of that and try to eat. I had Sat down to eat at 210 or so and 320 rolled around and I had only ate about a third of my food since I had to get up constantly. \n\nAnyways, Friday I'm told they're going to try and give us a \"guaranteed 30min break\" to sit down and eat. Once you're done eating you're supposed to get back to work. Once your meal is done so is your break. Physical books are banned because they don't want me to eat to use the full 30min break time.

We'll be engaged soon. We like to say we bonded over murder. Happy Birthday, and thank you, Dame Agatha. My first Christie was \u2018Murder On The Orient Express.\u2019\n\nI was 11, and, early one morning, helping a friend and his family move into his new place. The previous tenants hadn\u2019t cleared out everything, including this huge, stinking old mattress on the 1st floor (that\u2019s the 2nd floor for people from civilisations that haven\u2019t yet unlocked the metric system technology). We tossed the ugly thing out of the window.\n\nAnd there, hidden for god knows how long  between the fetid foam and splintered bed slats, was this slim and sorry looking paperback.\n\nAt that point I already fancied myself a \u2018mature\u2019 reader of refined tastes, having ploughed through about 80 volumes of the Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew mysteries, and ready to complete another 60 over the summer break.\n\nHonestly, I was glad to find an alternative. It was beginning to strike me that I was increasingly frequently being able to predict exactly what was gonna happen to Frank and Joe and Nancy. It was like those books were formulaic or something.\n\nAround 10am my friend\u2019s parents ran out of things to give me to do., so they fed me some KFC and turned in to nap.\n\nNo one was expecting me anywhere, so I found an empty hammock at the playground and began to read. I remember hoping I\u2019d find a racy scene or two.\n\nI didn\u2019t move for the next eight hours. Sun was pretty much about to set, and my bladder was about to burst. I whizzed into a large drain and walked home in a bit of a stupor. I honestly can\u2019t remember any earlier instance of having my mind well and truly fucked.\n\nNo one\u2019s seen me in eight hours, so they were just about to start getting worried.  I don\u2019t think I really listened to the chewing out I got.  At some point Mum told me to go bathe before dinner.  I remember them knocking on the bathroom door, asking me if I was getting married or something coz I\u2019d been in there for 20 minutes. I hadn\u2019t even soaped myself.\n\nAt dinner I\u2019m still spaced out so Dad finally asks wtf  is wrong with me and where\u2019d I\u2019d been.  I asked him if he\u2019s ever heard of someone called Agatha Christie.\n\nHe, Mum and Gran all ask why at the same time.\n\nI tell him she\u2019s an author, and I\u2019d spend the day reading a novel she wrote, and that she\u2019s got about sixty more, and that I was done with those dumb Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew, and that she was the only author (other than Rowling) that I wanted to read anymore, and that it was the best book ever written, and that if they hadn\u2019t read it then I was gonna make them, coz they didn\u2019t know what they were missing out on, and then I went on to spell out and spoil the whole plot for them.\n\nThey politely wait for me to finish before they start sniggering. Gran tells me I\u2019m obnoxious, and Mum\u2019s starting to laugh her head off, and Dad takes me to the master bedroom, to the bookshelf he shares with mum (which up to this point I\u2019ve entirely ignored because I\u2019ve got my own bookshelf and it\u2019s way more interesting), and tosses down five more Christies and says I can keep them.\n\nI remember being amazed at the sheer coincidence that he\u2019d have books by an author I stumbled across so randomly. It\u2019d be a few more years before I realised that  the only one who\u2019d outsold Christie was Bill Shakespeare, and that\u2019s coz he had a 300 year headstart.\n\nSo it turns out Mom had been reading Christie since she was 16, Dad since 14, and Gran had been reading regional translated copies of Christie since she\u2019d been 15 back in 1951.\n\nDad asked me to add the book I found to my library before I forgot. Way ahead of you, Dad, coz I just then realise I forgot it in the hammock.\n\nFive minutes later I\u2019m back at the hammock, nearly throwing up from sprinting on a full stomach. The book was gone. Not in the hammock, not near the drain, or at any point on the way home. Crushed, I was. Gran does her Gran thing and says that was probably what that copy\u2019s fate or purpose was: to bounce from unwary reader to unwary reader to introduce them to Christie just like  it introduced me.\n\nYeah, nice story Gran, but fine, I\u2019ll play.\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m the only one of us who has read every single one of Christie\u2019s murder mysteries though.\n\nThat was 19 years ago. Then, 8 years ago Christie served as the best wingwoman I ever had.\n\nAnd earlier this morning my girlfriend and I were telling a mutual friend (who hadn\u2019t read any of the books) what Christie meant to us. She seemed intrigued, and so my girlfriend and I are gonna buy her a book each. \n\nMy girlfriend\u2019s serving up \u2018Death on the Nile\u2019, and obviously, it\u2019s \u2018Murder On The Orient Express\u2019 from me.\n\nEDIT: Well, this became a thing overnight. What a wholesome and cool bunch you all are! Love you guys! Much gratitude for the gold, anon Redditor. \n\nA: Much gratitude for the many many engagement-to-be congrats. I guess this makes you guys the first to congratulate us, so you're all special to my gf and I now.\n\nB: To those inspired by this post asking for Christie recommendations, check this list of my favourite dozen. If you like working up to the greatest stuff, read these in ascending order; read in descending order if you like starting with the greatest.\n\n>Murder on the Orient Express \n\n>And Then There Were None\n\n>Death on the Nile\n\n>Evil Under the Sun\n\n>Cards on the Table\n\n>Nemesis\n\n>Towards Zero \n\n>N or M?\n\n>Appointment with Death\n\n>A Murder Is Announced\n\n>Taken at the Flood\n\n>The A.B.C. Murders\n\nC: To those saying this belongs on r/nobodyasked: Firstly, this was the only Christie-related post on Christie's birthday. Secondly, this subreddit isn't just about talking about books; it's also about how you relate to them. So the fact that this sub exists and we're all here... well... r/everyoneasked.\n\nD: To those saying I'm a shit/obnoxious writer: I agree, if you're saying I'm have an incomplete sense of finesse or technique. But if you think writing well has nothing to do with creating a certain reminiscence-y mood or touching folks with the feels, then y'all don't know what you think you know it means to be a writer. Whatever. Beauty in the eyes of the beholder and all that.\n\nE: For those asking for recommendations of writers 'Similar to Agatha Christie', there aren't any, but I've got two for you anyway. If Christie's 'hook' was **'Whodunnit?'** then these two authors had 'hooks' of their own:\n\n> James Hadley Chase. His hook is \"What happens next?\" He did for general crime - robbery, kidnapping etc - what Christie did specifically for murder. Also, his stories are told from the criminal's POV.\n\n> Erle Stanley Gardner's Perry Mason Series: His hook is \"GUILTY or *Innocent*?\" Dramatic courtroom pulp.  These are a bit of a guilty pleasure because they're most sensational and lurid things you'll ever read.\n\n> Bonus: Sherlock Holmes, obviously, but I'd be amazed if people didn't know who that was."}, {"subreddit": "science", "label": 2, "post": "A breathing tube through the rectum could be an alternative to mechanical ventilators.

Also, one of mine I feel like there are a lot of packages out there that are incredibly useful, but often get overlooked for one reason or another. It seems like people spend a lot of time re-implementing something that's already been done pretty well, and that's too bad. Because, using a nice package with a slick api is like taking a breath of crisp morning mountain air.\n\nSo here's some packages I love that I think folks should know about and take a look for themselves:\n\n[Inflection](http://inflection.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): Inflection is ridiculously useful. It has all kinds of tools for altering strings into different formats. Think, conversion from CamelCase to snake\\_case. Or, even ordinalizing numbers (1 -> 'first'). Pluralization is in there too. It's really handy with lots of features. I've used it for a few years now without any problems and a whole lot of fresh air in my life.\n\n[Pendulum](https://pendulum.eustace.io/): Python's datetime library is....well, painful to use. It has most everything you need, but doing what you want might be a whole afternoon of consternation. I used a few date/time libraries before I stumbled onto Pendulum. This library is really great. Not only does it offer a great parser that you rarely have to provide anything more than a string representation of a datetime, but it has lots of really useful utilities for working with dates and times (and both). Finally, the best part is that it's a \\_drop-in\\_ replacement! In fact, Pendulum DateTime objects inherit from python's native DateTime, so you can almost always use them anywhere you would use normal DateTime. This one has been a favorite for a long time.\n\n[pprintpp](https://github.com/wolever/pprintpp): Python's native pretty-printer often renders stuff that's...well, not pretty at all. I often deal with a lot of deeply nested native data-structures (basically JSON rendered into python), and when I'm debugging python's pretty-printer feels pretty stuffy. Enter pprintpp. It's a drop-in replacement that can monkey-patch the built-in pprint function. At any rate, my deeply-nested dicts are formatted with a whole lot more readability in my logs with this package\n\n[Snakeviz](https://jiffyclub.github.io/snakeviz/): Profiling performance becomes a pretty necessary task in most python projects with any degree of longevity. However, exploring profile dumps can be a super stuffy experience a lot of times. I've suffered through enough non-intuitive files and interfaces trying to dig down to the cause of slowness in my lifetime. Then, I found Snakeviz. It provides a really intuitive, interactive, in-browser way to explore profiling information. This tool has actually made profiling fun and exciting, and I can't recommend it enough.\n\n[Livereload](https://github.com/lepture/python-livereload): Suppose you're doing something like, say, working on your project's documentation. It's really not fun to, after each tweak of your config or doc files, have to manually run the sphinx-build commands and then open the produced html in a browser. Instead, you might try Livereload. You provide a list of files to watch, run it, and open a browser. Then, any time you change the file, your page will automatically reload. It's a core element of one of my personal projects (sphinx-view...and this doesn't count as my plug), and without it things would be a lot more painful. It can also be used for any number of other situations where html is produced from source files. It's pretty easy to use, too, and soo crisp and cool when you see it in action.\n\nFinally...my plug:\n\n[py-buzz](https://github.com/dusktreader/py-buzz): \"That's not flying, it's falling with style.\" Honestly...I have way too much fun with the name. The whole point of this package is that I found myself re-writing the same pattern over and over with custom exceptions. Typically, when I'm writing a new library, I end up with a custom exception base-class that I use (along with derived exceptions) throughout the project. Then, I end up doing the same thing over and over. Well, I took that irritation and turned it into a tool. The handiest parts of this package is the \\`Buzz.require\\_condition\\` function that acts like an assert that isn't disabled in production and \\`Buzz.handle\\_errors\\` which gives you a context manager to handle exceptions within a block. I dog-food the hell out of this package, so it should be in great working order. There's other neat features, but I'll let you read up yourself, if you're interested.\n\nIf not, please enjoy learning about the other 5 packages above.\n\nAnd, please remember, if you find yourself dealing with something annoying: Stop. Google the problem. Find a package that already does it. Install that.

Some of my favorite local artists aren't big-named bands, but quite often show up on my Pandora stations.  The other day 3 songs from one of my favorite small bands came up nearly one after the other and I sent screenshots to my buddy who was the singer in the band basically telling him he was welcome for the money I was making him on Pandora.\n\nHe told me he makes about $.01 per stream of his songs.\n\nI don't think I'm surprised by that, but I immediately felt like I should go buy his album off iTunes, because, well, here I was at work, enjoying his work, for basically free.\n\nBut I have the album.  What I really wanted was to just throw him a few bucks for letting me listen to his songs.\n\nI don't know if this is a good idea, or if it's been tried before to failure, but had there been a 'tip jar' option there, I'd have sent him a few dollars.\n\nAnyone else think that would be a good idea or was I just feeling like being a nice person because I felt guilty about enjoying my friends work for free?\n\n* edit quote to quite\n\n**UPDATE - Had a couple ask for the band - wasn't sure if I could/should post it, but here is who I was listening to when I was thinking about it.**\n\nI was too lazy to read the rules of the sub and didn't know if it would be considered promoting and get banned.  (still don't)\n\nBand's name is/was Resident Hero, they toured with FlyLeaf and Ryan White, the lead singer often did a lot of duet work with Lindsey, the lead singer of FlyLeaf.  (I think that's her name).\n\nGreat song - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tz8N4p9UyQ\n\n**UPDATE 2**\n\nFront page, huh?  That's pretty cool.  I hope it's because a lot of people would use it to tip their bands.  A lot of comments about how this already exists on other sites, which is great.  The problem is... that I like pop music.  I like top 40's.  I prefer to listen to that primarily, and have the old indie stuff and touring bands in there, too.  I like Pandora because it does that, the smaller platforms that have been mentioned don't really offer that.  And to really make some decent money for these artists, they need a platform that's as omnipresent as Pandora or Spotify - I'm on the internet all day long, and I've never heard of some of these other platforms that were mentioned, but SHOULD be more widely known, so I'm going to post the ones I saw here:\n\nhttp://huzza.io - cool idea - i actually signed up for the beta based on the comment below\nhttps://www.patreon.com/\nhttp://peertracks.com/\nhttp://noisetrade.com/\nhttp://help.grooveshark.com/customer/portal/articles/669416-flattr - this is interesting, and pretty close to what i was talking about.  I wish I liked Grooveshark more and as near as I can tell, they don't have a mobile app...\n\nThere were a lot of comments about Pandora not taking any fees for this service.  I disagree with that because someone has to build it and maintain it and manage it and audit it, and I think those people should be paid for their services.  \n\nSomeone said they sent it to their girlfriend that works at Pandora - that's awesome, I wish I'd chosen a less offensive username; I literally have no idea why I picked that."}, {"subreddit": "travel", "label": 9, "post": "If you have time for it on a trip to Japan, I strongly recommend hiking Fuji :) "}, {"subreddit": "politics", "label": 7, "post": "Trump's 'Don't be afraid of COVID' tweet may be the most irresponsible one in history "}, {"subreddit": "books", "label": 4, "post": "French literary circles indulged pedophile writer Gabriel Matzneff for over 35 years, now one of his victim is an editor and author publishing her memoirs of the abuse "}, {"subreddit": "books", "label": 4, "post": "Public libraries across North America to protest publisher\u2019s ebook restrictions "}, {"subreddit": "sports", "label": 8, "post": "Joe Mauer using his spidey senses to catch a ball "}, {"subreddit": "travel", "label": 9, "post": "My friend took this photo last week during the vacation we took at White Lake in Mongolia.

It's amazing to me how far I've been able to come with the assistance and coaching of my two best friends, producers by the name of KIDYOUNOT and Wulfmanik.\n\nI'm a little self conscious, but I'm releasing my second EP today, and I'm finally ready to show the world what we've made. I would adore any form of feedback, constructive criticism, or advice the community might have for me as a new(er) artist.\n\nHere it is!\nhttps://soundcloud.com/midaswright/sets/satellites-ep\n\nFor any artist out there like me who have been working tirelessly for years but are just starting to put themselves out there, feel free to message me! I'd love to create something together, offer feedback, or really anything I could do for the community.\n\nALSO, one of my producers, KIDYOUNOT, is offering a free beat pack with the sound of the EP!\nSnatch your 5 free beats here: https://soundcloud.com/iamkidyounot/sets/midas\n\n*edit:* WOW!

I've read (almost) every Stephen King novel, novella, short story, and non-fiction under his name - I'm missing the *Gwendy* works, the book about the 2004 Red Sox season, and when he puts out a short story as a part of a multi-author anthology.\n\nWhat I have come across is people voicing their opinion about how \"Classic King\" is better than \"Sober King.\" They can't stand works like *Insomnia*, *Cell*, the Bill Hodges Trilogy, etc. I think it would be easier to think of King's career as smaller careers instead of one big omnibus, which has been done for other artists, usually musicians.\n\nFor example, Aerosmith had a successful career in the '70s - early '80s, and had a separate career starting with their RUN-DMC collaboration remaking \"Walk This Way.\" AC/DC is broken up into the Bon Scott and Brian Johnson eras by fans. Most of this is done so that fans of the artist can explain what they enjoy more to other fans or newcomers.\n\nEra I - *Carrie* (1974) to *The Dark Half* (1989) - What is largely considered \"Classic\" King, including his releases as Richard Bachman. King was drinking and drugging *hard* through this era. In *On Writing*, he admits that he doesn't remember writing *Cujo*. This is when King was the \"King of Horror\" that marketing professionals the world over will never let us forget.\n\nEra II - *Needful Things* (1991) to *The Dark Tower* (2004) - This is when almost everything King wrote was pulled into The Dark Tower. This is where I think King's least-appreciated works lie. My favourite King novel is *Dolores Claiborne*. There are some stumbles here, too. *Dreamcatcher* doesn't need to be talked about and *Rose Madder*'s antagonist is so one-dimensional that [DoodleBob](https://spongebob.fandom.com/wiki/DoodleBob) could do it better. What is lacking here is King's quality output regarding novellas and short stories. What he put out isn't bad in this time but the limitations and focus on novels hampered his creativity, in my opinion. \n\nEra III - *The Colorado Kid* (2005) to present - After finishing *The Dark Tower*, King had some shaky recovery work (*Cell* isn't his best effort). When the releases began to truly satiate King fans is debatable. For me, *Just After Sunset* and *Full Dark, No Stars* should be thanked for reminding him to exercise all of his creative muscles instead of focusing solely on one set. \n\nIf you've made it this far, thank you for indulging me. I'm curious if you agree with the eras as I've defined them, and what your favourite book/short story collection from each era would be. Or, if you entirely disagree with the concept, I'd like to hear about that, too."}, {"subreddit": "entertainment", "label": 0, "post": "Happy 97th Birthday, Betty White: The legendary Golden Girl's life in photos "}, {"subreddit": "travel", "label": 9, "post": "Two rivers merging in Nepal "}, {"subreddit": "science", "label": 2, "post": "The Oxford COVID-19 vaccine shows a strong immune response.

I'm a big fan of apocalyptic and post apocalyptic fiction and after reading too many of these books during the pandemic, it's abundantly clear this trope is completely played out. I get it, it's human drama on a primal level. It's one of the ultimate fears in a world without modern medicine. It's not a death sentence like many other medical conditions, no one is getting a new heart valve installed or liver transplant. But it feels like I've seen every conceivable variation on this theme and I hope authors will note how over saturated this is in the genre. It's bad enough that as soon as a female protagonist is having sex, you know the story is going to revolve around her pregnancy.\n\nAnd honestly, it smacks of a little casual sexism. It reduces otherwise complex characters down to this narrow view and reason to survive. It gives every generic leading man a righteous cause to fight for. I get why it's used, but it's time to let a female protagonist have a different obstacle.\n\nThoughts? I fully recognize it's part of the human experience so it's inherently going to be a part of fiction. And as a father it does have intended gut punch for me imagining trying to care for my own daughter in these circumstances. It's effective and breaks my heart every time I read such a story, I just wish it was so pervasive that the moment a woman, particularly if she's a protagonist, hooks up with someone I know where the story is going.\n\nEdit: I think a lot of people are getting hung up thinking I don't think the story should involve pregnancy. It absolutely is going to be part of the world building and having a decent sized community with no pregnant women would be weird. My point is that it's a bit played out having the same scene of the protagonist having sex, immediately getting pregnant from that first coupling, and start vomiting out of nowhere one chapter later letting the audience know she's pregnant. I'd feel the same way if every post apocalyptic book with a male protagonist had a man suffer from testicular torsion. And if every time in a book a man has stomach pain you go, yep here we go again, it's another testicular torsion tale. Can't they make him have any other obstacles to cause character growth?\n\nEdit 2: Since I'm getting the same messages over and over I want to make a couple clarifications and point out the good discussion I got. \n\nFirst that a lot of people think these plots are necessary to the genre or like them. Totally fine, I can appreciate that. My frustration is not with pregnancy being dealt with in a post apocalyptic community, but rather the trope of a pregnant woman needing to be rescued during say a zombie outbreak or mass unrest. The same way I feel about the inclusion of the token child or old man on bottled oxygen. In longer term stories it absolutely is going to be part of survival. You can stop telling me humans will need to reproduce to survive or that contraception is scarse. I assure all 500 of you that I understand basic human biology.\n\nSecondly, the sexism angle. This was taken by many as no women should be pregnant, or that I'm somehow implying that mentioning pregnancy is somehow offensive. That's a real stretch but was apparently how that read to a lot of people. My entire arguement on this is making a protagonist pregnant for the sole purpose of providing an obstacle is at best lazy writing but worth considering why that's the go to plot device for female protagonists. Some of you had thoughtful rebuttals that this isn't sexism, but solely uncreative writing. Fair enough, I'm not an expert but I thought it was worth exploring. \nWay too many people turned their brains off when they saw that word and decided it was better to just yell about political correctness. Honestly pretty disappointing that so many of you decided to not even consider the argument and get mad about it. It must be infuriating to try to find books that don't challenge your held beliefs. And I really didn't think I needed a sarcasm tag after a joke about testicular torsion but here we are.\n\nThis was not my mla dissertation, just an observation on reading too much similar genre fiction that I hoped would have interesting discussion on the trope and books that subvert or play with those expectations. And for the posters that have no idea what I'm talking about see for example:\nThe Stand - Stephen King\nThe Fireman - Joe Hill \nSeverance - Ling Ma\nThe Last One - Alexandra Oliva \nThe Walking Dead- Fall of the Governor - Jay Bonansinga \nSleeping Giants Series - Sylvain Neuvel \nWanderers - Chuck Wendig \nAnd plenty more I can't remember off the top of my head. I liked almost all of these books, but the repetition of the pregnant protagonist got old. The Stand gets a pass because it's just my favorite. \nA couple good example of bucking this trope are Station Eleven by Emily St. John Mandel and Wool by Hugh Howie."}, {"subreddit": "sports", "label": 8, "post": "Roy Jones Jr takes a moment to think about how good he is.

We have seen him do so many evil things. If you don't know who Trump is by now, I don't really know what to say about you. Too Much and Never Enough is this woman's catharsis- its a way for her to release her trauma. Her book chronicles essentially, how she was became disenchanted with her family before 45 ever decided to run for office, how she was disinherited, and where Fred Trump comes into play as a lynchpin at the center of it all.\n\nMary's father, Fred Trump junior, was an outlier. Not necessary a good man, but a complicated one who had made a number of visible mistakes before she was even born. She describes his dark relationship with his brother, and her father's slow physical and mental decline as he falls out of favor with Fred Senior. Much of this book is really told through her father's eyes, and through the stories he told her before his passing.\n\nMary's grandfather Fred is also hi lighted as an abuser that gaslit and traumatized his children, saw the evil in his own younger son, and then raised him as an ideal son to take on the family name. Fred Senior's cruelty towards everyone around him, and shady business practices help shaped the monster we now know today as 45.\n\nAs for Donald Trump- Mary uses a number of personal and family stories to paint a picture of Trump's youth. Trump's behavior doesn't come out of thin air, and Mary is really able to paint a picture of 45 at his darkest, which started at a much earlier age than some may expect. These personal stories are chilling and callous- often reflecting his relationships with the American people during his four years as president.\n\nYou get some interesting little tidbits about \"modern\" behavior from the family as well, from small squabbles to election night anecdotes. Imagine the literary families of Long days Journey Into the Night or Haunting of Hill House. The Trump family in Mary's book is almost laughably literary \"broken wealthy\". The story of the rise and fall of the Trumps plays out like a screenplay. Later on in the book, Mary talks a lot more about contending with Donald and the family personally as she is disinherited. \n\nI highly recommend Too Much and Never Enough, even if you don't find yourself often drawn towards non fiction- if only because this is a simple and easy to follow biography that helps us understand how we got where we are now. How Donald Trump, against all odds, rose in the ranks of his own family from a younger \"second son\", and ended up making all of us pay for his neurosis.\n\nI think most folks would go into this worried that Mary is providing excuses or sympathy for her family, and I can assure you that is not the case. Mary is an exceptional author and intelligent woman who makes no excuses for her family, and manages to tell a hard and painful story with striking objectivity and honesty."}, {"subreddit": "sports", "label": 8, "post": "Windy day on the golf course "}, {"subreddit": "politics", "label": 7, "post": "Biden declares October 11 Indigenous Peoples' Day and says restoring national monuments is the 'easiest thing I've ever done so far as President' "}, {"subreddit": "entertainment", "label": 0, "post": "Kim Kardashian and Kanye West are getting a divorce: \u2018She\u2019s done\u2019 "}, {"subreddit": "politics", "label": 7, "post": "Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley could be put on no-fly list, House homeland security chair says "}, {"subreddit": "music", "label": 6, "post": "Bob Dylan becomes first artist with a US Top 40 album in every decade since the 1960s "}, {"subreddit": "gaming", "label": 3, "post": "Still miss watching Red vs Blue "}, {"subreddit": "technology", "label": 5, "post": "GitHub apologizes for firing Jewish employee who warned of Nazis in U.S. Capitol: TechCrunch "}, {"subreddit": "travel", "label": 9, "post": "Oia, Santorini ... absolutely breathtaking.

I think the idea of fantasy worlds are so cool. I love seeing dragons and magic and struggles between good and evil. It's all amazing to me. But when some people get their panties in a twist about forced diversity because one background character is darker than others it just makes me think that you're too indoctrinated by this political climate we live in to enjoy the actual story. There's a fucking dragon getting slayed but you are pissed there's an Asian wizard in the background in the climatic fight scene? That doesn't sound like an actual grevience. Sounds like a personal problem.\n\nI'll take it a step further. I don't care if main characters are diverse. If it's a fictional world not based on any real people I say go nuts. People say it's pandering but litterally it's all pandering. White dudes get pandered too so much they don't even notice it like a fish in water. Let me have a bad ass Asian dude on a quest to unite the four kingdoms with a bad ass party full of knights and wizards. I don't care as long as the story is good but someone being a different skin color in a fantasy setting that's not based on actual things that happened doesn't and shouldn't bother anyone.\n\nEdit: Quick notes because I got pretty overwhelmed with the response.\n\n* when I say Asian I mean people of Asian decent in the story. Not litterally from Asia in a fictional universe. Like you'd describe Asian coded people in your world like how the shu are described in 6 of crows. Not put Asian products africa in your fantasy world.\n\n* I don't mean only Asian or black people. It's every miniority underrepresented people in fantasy. Gay, Indian, trans, Hispanic etc etc.\n\n* saying \"but what if they changed black Panther white isn't a gotcha. It's a really clich\u00e9 disengenous argument..\n\n* Diversity doesn't ever need justification. Ever. I shouldn't ever have to justify my existence. Especially when you never try to justify the existence of white people.\n\n* representation is important. Just because you don't personally see the value of it doesn't mean it isn't valuable.\n\n* yes I have read more than one fantasy book. The fact that people would attack me and gatekeep because I haven't read your favorite series is messed up. I'm just as real of a fan as you.\n\n* me making this post isn't forcing diversity down your throat.\n\n* saying I don't want diversity I just want good stories is just telling on yourself. Firstly, wanting both is perfectly okay. Secondly, they aren't mutually exclusive.\n\n* no, \"just imagining the characters as whatever you want\" isn't an answer. If the character is clearly described as a white dude, and is casted as a white dude in the movies, me imagining he looks like me does nothing to fix the issues we're talking about.\n\n* asking why people still care about skin color ignores how many people can't choose to ignore their skin color. In America people are still treated differently and have very different lived experiences because of their skin color. Stop saying that like it's a obvious answer it's not and it's off topic.\n\n* no wanting more diversity isn't racist.\n\n* I truly don't care about karma. It can't buy me anything. I never understood reddits obsession with karma. I didn't realize there's an unwritten rule about not crossposting after a certain date. So if that bothered you I'm sorry. I updated the post with the bulleted thoughts because the intention wasn't to do that. \n\nLook man all I wanted to do here was vent about how I wanted to see more diverse fantasy but yall one one. No one should be called racist because they care about representation."}, {"subreddit": "travel", "label": 9, "post": "Ran into a roadblock on the way to Mt.

To his dear parents\n\nhe never made return for all their care, \n\nbut had his life cut short when Ajax\u2019s shaft\n\nunmanned him. In the lead, as he came on, \n\nhe took the spear-thrust squarely in the chest\n\nbeside the nipple on the right side; piercing him, \n\nthe bronze point issued by the shoulder blade, \n\nand in the dust he reeled and fell. \n\nA poplar growing in bottom lands, in a great meadow, \n\nsmooth-trunked, high up to its sheath of boughs, \n\nwill fall before the chariot-builder\u2019s ax, ...\n\nand, seasoning, it lies beside the river. \n\nSo vanquished by the god-reared Ajax lay\n\nSimeoisios Anthemides.\n\n- Homer\u2019s *Iliad*, Book IV\n\nOne of my very favorite passages in all of world literature is the death of this random Trojan soldier, Simeoisios, who isn\u2019t mentioned anywhere else in Homer\u2019s epic outside of these brief few lines. The fragility of life, the cyclical nature of conception and birth and death, the violence of war and the death of young Simeoisios juxtaposed with the violence of the ax and the gradual, languid rotting of the poplar... In a few lines, we see an entire life from beginning to end, and it\u2019s not cheap or distracting but ethereally beautiful. The descriptions are just enough that you can picture his parents conceiving him on the banks of the river that gave him his name, his parents realizing they will never see their son again, the blood and dust of the fields of Troy, and the slow decay of a felled tree, each scene a perfect successor to the previous. Plus, a major theme of Homer\u2019s epics is that quest for immortality which in our mortal, corporal world is only possible through glory, honor, and legacy. A premature death in battle is the secret to life-everlasting in the minds of men. And this unremarkable soldier achieved it in these few brief lines, and now his death is still read about eons later.

Backstory: \n\nWhen I met Chuck Palahniuk at his book signing, I broke down like someone who was meeting their hero, because, honestly, of the top ten people that I admire, he's way, WAY up there. \n\nDuring the meet and greet, Chuck and my daughter had their heads together, and hatched a plan. Chuck asked her to write him a letter about me, what I liked, what my dreams were, and who I was as a person. \nShe wrote him an amazing letter, and seeing her write such wonderful things about me was honestly a wonderful gift in and of itself. \nDuring the cover of night, she wrote the letter and passed it on to my husband to mail. \n\nToday: \nI get a text from my daughter that I have a package waiting at home. I was confused as I had not ordered anything. \n(And trust me when I say today was an awful day.)\n\nI get home and see the box with a note in front of it that says \"This Was Our Secret\". The return address was from Chuck. \n\nAfter the tears stopped, the items I began to pull out of this glitter-packed box were each more hilarious and poignant than the next. \nHe sent me soap (of COURSE), candles, incense and lots of candy. He sent me birthday candles and miniature sparklers. He sent me funny pens and copies of his tour CDs. \n\nAnd the two most important items, a personal letter and a \"bookmark\" that he made himself. It's got to be 4 feet long at minimum, made of pieces of his own mother's jewelry, carved jade and rocks he's picked up during his travels wrapped in the most ridiculous box I had ever seen. \n\nKnowing that he thought enough of me to give me things that belonged to his mother, things that he's cared enough about to collect, is completely overwhelming. \n  \nHe literally sent me a box of rocks and glitter, and I couldn't have asked for more. \n\nTruth be told, he didn't HAVE to do anything. \nI would be just as thrilled to have met him, shook his hand, and moved on. \nHe didn't have to find out anything about me. He could have sent me a leftover bookmark from one of his old signings. \n\nHe wanted to know one of his fans. \n\nI'm not his target demographic. I'm not a weightlifter with a Fight Club tattoo that thinks Tyler Durden was just a guy that fought a lot. \nI'm a middle-aged mother of a teenager that lives in the suburbs with a two car garage and a cat named after a cow noise. \n\nHe CARES about his fans as well as being one of the most brilliant minds of our times. \n\nAnd he uses the same brand of soap that we do. How awesome is THAT?\n\n(I suck at posting on Reddit, so I'm adding the link to my imgur below. It's all pictures of us meeting Chuck and of the package and letters. There's only one other picture there, of a hilarious snowman cookie I made a couple of years ago.) \n\nEnjoy my Chuck Bomb. \n\nP. S.  Sorry, Chuck, I'm never eating that candy. However, when I finally do open my candy store, it will go in a special display case. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/cKIVN\n\n\nEdit:  Ok this is so cool!  I'm loving all the stories!  Thank you everyone. \n\nCouple of things that I keep getting: \n\n- I do realize that the \"target demographic\" is different than what I mentioned. That comment was strictly tongue-in-cheek and a bit of a jab at myself and the fact that Tyler would be very disappointed in me as a person. \n\n- Apparently, some of you think I'm a \"MILF\". I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a bit flattered. It's the makeup. However, I did not \"fangirl over Chuck because he was hot\". They've been teaching women that good book learnin' for at least the past twenty years or so. \nHe also did not send me this because I'm a decent-looking female of the species. He does this for MANY fans. \n\n- Yes. My daughter is awesome, and I have no idea how I've raised such an incredible kid. I can barely keep a houseplant alive.  \n\n- I'm happily married. Regardless of that, please don't make jabs at single mothers, or single parents in general. It's a very difficult job with too little credit. You probably have no idea what it takes. \n\n- By request:  My Cat's name is Moo. I explained in the comments somewhere where her name came from. I will try with my limited knowledge of imgur to add a picture of her, because cat pictures are awesome.  Yay, I think I've got it. Here's some pictures of Moo with a couple of our hedgehog Edgar thrown in. We lost Edgar earlier this year to old age, and it still makes me sad. https://imgur.com/a/AbKke\n\n- I've tried to respond to everyone in the messages, but no, I do not have his personal address. Or his phone number. Even if I did, I would not violate his privacy that way after he did something so amazing for me. \n\nThank you everyone, again!  I've almost forgotten my face being thrown up on today, but not really. That was gross. \n\n\n"}, {"subreddit": "music", "label": 6, "post": "Kanye West confirms he and Drake are making an album together "}, {"subreddit": "sports", "label": 8, "post": "Kentucky cheerleader flips down the length of the basketball court "}, {"subreddit": "books", "label": 4, "post": "I am Allie Brosh.

"}, {"subreddit": "python", "label": 1, "post": "Enable ++x and --x expressions in Python By default, Python supports neither pre-increments (like `++x`) nor post-increments (like `x++`), commonly used in other languages. However, the first ones are *syntactically correct* since Python parses them as two subsequent `+x` operations, where `+` is the unary plus operator (same with `--x` and the unary minus). They both have no effect, since in practice `-(-x) == +(+x) == x`.\n\nI'd like to share the [plusplus](https://github.com/borzunov/plusplus) module that turns the `++x`\\-like expressions into `x += 1` at the bytecode level, using pure Python only.\n\nUnlike `x += 1`, `++x` is still an expression, so the increments work fine inside other expressions, `if`/`while` conditions, lambda functions, and list/dict comprehensions:\n\n    array[++index] = new_value\n    \n    if --connection.num_users == 0:\n        connection.close()\n    \n    button.add_click_callback(lambda: ++counter)\n    \n    index = 0\n    indexed_cells = {++index: cell for row in table for cell in row}\n\n**Note:** I don't claim that allowing increments is good for real projects (it may confuse new developers and give opportunities to write less readable code), though some situations when they simplify the code do exist. I've made this module for fun, as a demonstration of Python flexibility and bytecode manipulation techniques.\n\nThe module works by replacing the bytecode patterns corresponding to the `++x` and `--x` expressions with the bytecode for actual incrementing. For example, this is what happens for the `y = ++x` line:\n\n[Two consecutive UNARY\\_POSITIVE instructions are replaced with adding one and storing the result back to the original place](https://preview.redd.it/2k692gaulan71.png?width=821&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b440b0cf9bc2bae5a2695f1831a810f0d5f55d4)\n\nIt's not always that simple: incrementing object attributes and collection items requires much trickier bytecode manipulation (see the [\"How it works\"](https://github.com/borzunov/plusplus#how-it-works) section in the docs for details).\n\nTo use the module, you can just run `pip install plusplus` and add two lines of code enabling the increments. You may do this for just one function or for the whole package you're working on (see the [\"How to use it?\"](https://github.com/borzunov/plusplus#how-to-use-it) section).\n\n**Updates:**\n\n* The same approach could be used to implement the assignment expressions for the Python versions that don't support them. For example, we could replace the `x <-- value` expressions (two unary minuses + one comparison) with actual assignments (setting `x` to `value`).\n* See also [cpmoptimize](https://kukuruku.co/post/automatic-algorithms-optimization-via-fast-matrix-exponentiation/) \\- my older project about Python bytecode manipulation. It optimizes loops calculating linear recurrences, reducing their time complexity from O(n) to O(log n).

They spent at least 2 hours a day posting/deleting products and making sure everything matched between the two sites. That's over 40 hours a month that could be saved by a relatively simple Beautiful Soup/Selenium solution.\n\nThese scenarios are not rare, any business I've ever known has repetitive tasks that can be automated and save countless hours in the long run.

Something like Zapier, which seems obvious to us, is intimidating to some of the less tech savvy small business owners. Simply setting up a few useful Zaps would warrrent a decent fee IMO.\n\nOne thing I haven't figured out is how you would go about pricing. For my above example let's say my script could save the owner \u00a34,000 a year \u2014 what is a reasonable one off fee?

There was a post about this a month ago, but bringing it up again.\n\nOn the one hand, I'm grateful that many women have written gay fiction that I enjoy. A lot of these works have changed the way I relate to my own sexuality in a very positive way.\n\nOn the other hand, I think many women write gay men just as poorly as the stereotype of men writing women poorly, and it's frustrating to read. Sometimes gay men are written as an expression of how some women wish straight men would act. Stereotypically soft, not status driven, not very sexually active, surrounded by supportive and protective women (often self-inserts). The villains are traditionally masculine characters.\n\nThere are some dick-brained, stupid ass gay guys out there. There are hyper-masculine gays and stereotypically feminine gays straight out of anime or something. I have personally behaved in stupid and gross ways because of thinking with my penis, just like (some) straight guys. I have also sometimes acted like the gay stereotypes I listed above. But those stereotypes are over-represented specifically in gay fiction written by women.\n\nTo give you an example of unrealistic behavior: In one comic I read, when the two love interests were finally ready to have \"their first time\" with each other -- I kid you not, they sat down next to each other and googled \"how to have gay sex,\" clothes on, seemingly uninterested. This is the perfect expression of a sort of calculated, slow-burn sexuality that is rare in gay guys and more common in women. It's definitely there. I personally know some gay guys who maybe wouldn't do *that* but would do things in that ballpark. But it's usually all you see from women writing gay men.\n\nSo whatever, maybe that fiction just isn't for me. It's written by women, for women. I think I'm allowed to be annoyed by it, though...\n\nEdit: Just to be clear. Pasting a comment I wrote.\n\n>I\u2019d  even say it\u2019s good to write stereotypically flamboyant gay men. Those  people are real, I know plenty and they probably need more  representation too.  \n>  \n>These  characters I\u2019m talking about are like... female stereotypes inside of  gay male bodies. Flamboyant gay men are still men. Hard to explain.  These characters lack a sense of maleness even behind our traditional  ideas of masculinity.  \n>  \n>That\u2019s ok to be in real life, and those people exist and I think they\u2019re interesting.

If you liked watching \"The Room,\" you'll love reading Dean Koontz's *WHISPERS*. It's kind of like James Patterson's *KISS THE GIRLS*, except the plot is completely different, and it is even more stupid.\n\nSETUP:\n \nOur protagonists are flying on a Cessna airplane in 1980.\n\nTHE SENTENCE:\n\nFor a minute, the three of them sat in silence, within the expensive, single-engine, overhead-wing, two-hundred-mile-per-hour, sixteen-mile-per-gallon, white and red and mustard-yellow, airborne cocoon.\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nIf you are Dan Brown, you are probably taking notes so you can imitate that fabulous sentence structure. It was very descriptive. You probably like the way Dean Koontz fit the word \"expensive\" in there, just in case his readers thought Cessna airplanes were cheap. \n\nI liked the way Koontz tried to set the world record for commas per character in a published sentence. I mean, I can totally picture that Cessna in my head. Can't you? I also like the way Koontz's name makes me think about vaginas.\n\nSpeaking of vaginas, the sex scenes in this novel would make Danielle Steele fingerbang herself in a heartbeat.

Hello everyone!\n\nI'm Richard S. aka ichard26 and I'm one of the core team responsible for psf/black ([repo](https://github.com/psf/black), [docs](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable)), a project dedicated to making sure your ~~car~~ code is painted black. Black is notable for its general lack of configuration and secondary focus on reducing diff noise.\n\nThis AMA will be at least (we have a sizable team of 9 folks) joined by\n\n* [\u0141ukasz Langa](https://github.com/ambv) \\-- creator, maintainer & BDFL\n* [Jelle Zijlstra](https://github.com/JelleZijlstra), /u/ucucha \\-- maintainer\n* [Zsolt Dollenstein](https://github.com/zsol) \\-- maintainer\n* [me](https://github.com/ichard26)! -- maintainer\n\n**The official start time for the AMA will be 17:00pm UTC**, before then this post will exist to collect questions in advance. Since we live all over North America and Europe, **it's likely we'll answer questions before & after the official start time by a significant margin**.\n\nBlack allows you to write your Python code however you like, and let it handle fixing your coding style for others, making it easier to just program and avoid time hunting down where your code violates style guide rules.\n\nI can't really comment on the early bits of the project's life as I only joined in mid-2020 so here's a quote from \u0141ukasz Langa, both the creator and BDLF:\n\n>At the time I was working for Facebook on their internal use of Python. There were over 20 million lines of code maintained and too much time during code review was wasted fighting over formatting. Plus different projects ended up having muuuch different coding styles, including some ex-Googlers forcing use of 2-spaced indents in their favorite projects. It was a mess.  \n>  \n>At first I tried adopting an existing code formatter, YAPF. \\[...\\] However, we couldn't make it work for our 20 million lines of code. It was very configurable but also very inconsistent because of it. \\[...\\]  \n>  \n>So I started working on my own. \"How hard can it be?\" Well, it took me 6 weeks to get to the first alpha release. When I put it out on March 14th 2018 (Pi Day!), it got 500 GitHub stars in one day, Kenneth Reitz started using it right away and tweeted about it, and soon after we got pretty big adoption.\n\nAnd after a few short years, it's become the most popular autoformatter for Python. FWIW just only a few days ago Black surpassed 100 million downloads on PyPI, but Black isn't stopping anytime soon. It'll still exist painting code in layers of black paint!\n\nIf you want to see how Black would reformat your code, [you can try it online](https://black.vercel.app/) and paste your code to see how it changes.\n\nAsk us anything!

If you want a better version, have a look a the video in the repo.](https://reddit.com/link/krmqiu/video/pai4g8w1ep961/player)\n\nOver the last year I've been working on a side project that leverages [Mycroft](https://mycroft.ai) (think: Alexa, but open-source and privacy-friendly) to do exciting things like stream video from Netflix, Amazon, and Youtube, or dig through your bookmarks for recipes etc.  It's finally in a state that I'm comfortable sharing with you all, [so here its](https://gitlab.com/danielquinn/majel).  I've named it *\"Majel\"* for [Majel Barrett-Roddenberry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majel_Barrett), a reference that'll make sense if you're a Trekkie.\n\n## Some technical notes about the architecture if you're interested:\n\n[Architecture diagram](https://preview.redd.it/ypm0jjv5ep961.png?width=1670&format=png&auto=webp&s=79ac6127afe9b3b87f863c6fb12844b28d21a319)\n\nMajel sits on top of Mycroft.ai's voice activation system as a set of three (at the moment anyway) \"skills\" that know what to do when certain voice commands are issued.  These skills do a little research around what a command might mean -- For example you could say: `\"play the west wing\"`, the `streamer-skill` will figure out where you're most likely to find [The West Wing](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0200276/) (including your local `.mkv` files) and then push the location of the stream into Mycroft's [message bus framework](https://mycroft-ai.gitbook.io/docs/mycroft-technologies/mycroft-core/message-bus) and exit.\n\nThe other part of the equation is the `majel` program that just listens for these messages and then executes different processes based on what comes down the pipe.  If it gets a Netflix or Amazon URL for example, it'll point your browser (using Selenium) to the stream in question and \"click\" the play button, if it's a local file, it'll play it with MPV (thanks to `python-mpv`), etc.\n\nAnyway, I'm really happy with how it's turned out and wanted to share.

Signing up gives you lifetime access so you can work on it at your own pace.\n* This Udemy course covers roughly the same content as the 1st edition book (the book has a little bit more, but all the basics are covered in the online course), which you can read for free online at https://inventwithpython.com\n* The 2nd edition of Automate the Boring Stuff with Python is free online: https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/\n* I do plan on updating the Udemy course for the second edition, but it'll take a while because I have other book projects I'm working on. If you sign up for this Udemy course, you'll get the updated content automatically once I finish it. It won't be a separate course.\n* It's totally fine to start on the first edition and then read the second edition later. I'll be writing a blog post to guide first edition readers to the parts of the second edition they should read.\n* I wrote a blog post to cover [what's new in the second edition](https://inventwithpython.com/blog/2019/10/07/whats-new-in-the-2nd-edition-of-automate-the-boring-stuff-with-python/)\n* **You're not too old to learn to code.

(OC) This took like 30-40 hours of mind-numbing grunt work, so I really hope some of you enjoy it. It's a really rather interesting list, and it's always fascinated me how despite 4chan's reputation, whenever their book lists come out each year they are always relatively respected and spark meaningful discussion. There are definitely biases here, and I'll touch on some of those, but for now here's the list:\n\n[CORRECTED VERSION, UNCOMPRESSED](https://postimg.cc/hzQc4Kms)\n\n[Corrected version, imgur, compressed](https://imgur.com/a/ilVYf8x)\n\nOriginal ones I posted with 9\\* errors:\n\n[Uncompressed postimg link](https://postimg.cc/YhhjYBcc)\n\n[Imgur link (compressed)](https://imgur.com/a/aqYkoiK)\n\n**Notes:**\n\n\\- They've only released 8 lists thus far, starting in 2014 and ending in 2020, with one year having two \"official\" list releases. I put this data together months ago, so I'm a bit hazy on the reason, but one of those two lists seemed to make far more sense to me at the time as the true list, so I just chose that one and disregarded the alternate list.\n\n\\- I hope the intro is understandable, but in case it's confusing: If a book appeared in at least 5 of 7 yearly lists, it is not penalized/lowered in rank for not appearing in the other 1 or 2. But books with 4 or less appearances are always ranked lower than books that appeared more often, even if they ranked higher on average. The number 5 may seem arbitrary, but I had to have some system to avoid outliers and that made the most sense to me.\n\n\\- The genres and page counts are shoddy. I wanted that aspect of the list to be simple so I just had one figure for each, and of course you can find a ton of different figures online. The page counts are primarily B&N, and the genres are primarily Wikipedia.\n\n**Observations:**\n\n\\- Books by American authors appear more than twice as often as any other nationality, with 29 occurrences. Then, English with 14, Russian with 11, French with 9, and Irish with 7. 61 books are from Europe, 4 from South America, and 2 from Asia (excluding the Bible, and Russian literature since it is usually grouped separately). Nearly half of the Russian novels appear in the top 20, though - their five novels in the top 20 fall just short of the 6 American novels in the top 20.\n\n\\- 4chan validates its reputation somewhat, as the list only features three female authors, one being JK Rowling.

About 25% of my way into the book, I realized that I was not enjoying the story, but again I felt like I owed it to the book to finish it, due to my love of the original works.

Signing up gives you lifetime access so you can work on it at your own pace.\n* This Udemy course covers roughly the same content as the 1st edition book (the book has a little bit more, but all the basics are covered in the online course), which you can read for free online at https://inventwithpython.com\n* The 2nd edition of Automate the Boring Stuff with Python is free online: https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/\n* I do plan on updating the Udemy course for the second edition, but it'll take a while because I have other book projects I'm working on. Expect that update to happen in mid-2021. If you sign up for this Udemy course, you'll get the updated content automatically once I finish it.

We\u2019re protesting nationwide on Dec 7th to stop them.\nHead over to http://www.verizonprotests.com/ for more info.**\n\n**WHAT\u2019S HAPPENING?**\nThe Federal Communications Commission (FCC) just [announced](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20171120/11253438653/fcc-plan-to-use-thanksgiving-to-hide-attack-net-neutrality-vastly-underestimates-looming-backlash.shtml) its plan to slash net neutrality rules, allowing ISPs like Verizon to block apps, slow websites, and charge fees to control what you see & do online. They vote December 14th. People from across the political spectrum are outraged, so we\u2019re planning to protest at Verizon retail stores across the country on December 7, one week before the vote and at the peak of the busy Holiday shopping season. We'll demand that our members of Congress take action to stop Verizon's puppet FCC from killing net neutrality.\n\n**WHAT\u2019S NET NEUTRALITY?**\nNet neutrality is the [basic principle](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/05/the-case-for-rebooting-the-network-neutrality-debate/361809/) that has made the Internet into what it is today. It prevents big Internet Service Providers (like Verizon) from charging extra fees, engaging in censorship, or controlling what we see and do on the web by throttling websites, apps, and online services.\n\n**WHY VERIZON STORES?**\nThe new chairman of the FCC, Ajit Pai, is a former top lawyer for Verizon, and the company has been spending millions on [lobbying](https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/12/15959932/comcast-verizon-att-net-neutrality-day-of-action) and lawsuits to kill net neutrality so they can gauge us all for more money. By protesting at Verizon stores, we\u2019re shining light on the corruption and demanding that our local do something about it. Only Congress has the power to stop Verizon's puppet FCC, so at the protests we'll be calling and tweeting at legislators, and in cities where it's possible we'll march from Verizon stores to lawmakers offices.\n\n**WHAT ARE OUR DEMANDS?**\nAjit Pai is clearly still working for Verizon, not the public. But he still has to answer to Congress. So we\u2019re calling on our lawmakers to do their job overseeing the FCC and speak out against Ajit Pai\u2019s plan to gut Title II net neutrality protections and give Verizon and other giant ISPs everything on their holiday wishlist. \n\n**HOW CAN I JOIN?**\n[Click here](https://events.battleforthenet.com/#eventType=protestrally) and you\u2019ll find an interactive map where you can see if there is already a protest planned near you. If not, you can [sign up to host one](http://act.demandprogress.org/event/team-internet/create/), and we\u2019ll send you materials to make it easy and help you recruit others in your area. These protests will be quick, fun, and 100% legal. If you can\u2019t attend a protest on December 7th, you can still help defend net neutrality by [calling your lawmakers](http://battleforthenet.com/) and spreading the word on social media. You can also sign up to host a meeting with your members of Congress, or volunteer for our texting team to help turn people out for these protests."}, {"subreddit": "python", "label": 1, "post": "Our bot scraps Udemy Coupons and then automatically enrolls you to those paid courses for FREE.

So, as a gift to him I recorded myself reading it so he could listen to it while he\u2019s away. Only took 10 hours, one minute, and 45 seconds. \n\nPlease don\u2019t rat me out if I\u2019ve broken copywriter laws! It\u2019s not for profit!!!\n\nEDIT: thanks for the awards! I shall sit on my pile of gold and silver like Smaug on his - and relish it for evermore!!\n\nNow, to those of you who have seemed to take such an offence that I read a book to him that I was read by an old boyfriend. Sorry you\u2019re miffed. But that was 25 years ago and I\u2019ve read the book (or parts of it at least) to lots of people - including my own kid. The ex\u2019s parents used to read it to he and his brother, he read it to me, I\u2019ve read it to others, I hope my son will read it to people. It\u2019s a nice book to have read to you - it\u2019s not a once in a lifetime opportunity. \n\nAnd, for the record, this guy knows how much the book has figured in my life, and that I\u2019ve read it to others as it was read to me. And it wasn\u2019t an issue. I, in fact, started reading it to him as he fell asleep one night and that\u2019s when I thought I should record it so he could take it with him. My friends who know about the little project want a copy too. It\u2019s a sweet gesture, not an original or sacred one.\n\nEDIT TWO: many of you are asking how I recorded myself - I downloaded the app \u201cDictaphone\u201d to my iPhone (but I\u2019m sure android has a similar version). It was a pretty easy app to navigate and I\u2019m pretty low tech). I recorded it chapter by chapter - some were ~10 mins, others ~50. Then I uploaded the files to my google drive and put them on a flash drive which I\u2019ll give to him before he goes. And I\u2019ll tell him about all this hoopla. He\u2019ll think it\u2019s funny - and in some cases, unwarranted. \n\nI\u2019d recommend if you want to try something similar to do a dry run with each chapter of whatever book you\u2019re reading - I think that would have made me goof less as it would have been fresher in my mind and in how the words flow. Granted that would at least double the time it takes to do any project. \n\nEDIT THREE: he really loved it. He thought it was the sweetest thing ever.

Wait, and then read all ten glorious books one after the other.\n\nTen years later I feel like I\u2019m finally ready to finally dive back into this glorious world that scored a lightning strike through my adolescence.

I look forward to seeing more people learn Python and pursue their passions through it. \ud83c\udf93\n\nHere are the primary goals of creating this guide:\n\n\ud83c\udfc6 **Serve as a resource** for Python newcomers who prefer to learn hands-on. This repository has a collection of standalone modules which can be run in an IDE like [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) and in the browser like [Repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/python3). Even a plain old terminal will work with the examples. Most lines have carefully crafted comments which guide a reader through what the programs are doing step-by-step. Users are encouraged to modify source code anywhere as long as the mainroutines are not deleted and [run successfully](https://github.com/huangsam/ultimate-python/blob/master/runner.py) after each change.\n\n\ud83c\udfc6 **Serve as a pure guide** for those who want to revisit core Python concepts. Only [builtin libraries](https://docs.python.org/3/library/) are leveraged so that these concepts can be conveyed without the overhead of domain-specific concepts. As such, popular open-source libraries and frameworks are not installed. However, reading the source code in these frameworks is inspiring and highly encouraged if your goal is to become a true [Pythonista](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=pythonista)."}, {"subreddit": "music", "label": 6, "post": "Arch Enemy ban photo journalist from their gigs after he tries to stop a private company misusing his image "}, {"subreddit": "travel", "label": 9, "post": "The isolated village of Ushguli, Georgia.

L.

If not across the Bay, then up the Golden Gate or down 101 to Los Altos or La Honda. . . . You could strike sparks anywhere. There was a fantastic universal sense that whatever we were doing was right, that we were winning. . . .\n\nAnd that, I think, was the handle\u2014that sense of inevitable victory over the forces of Old and Evil. Not in any mean or military sense; we didn\u2019t need that. Our energy would simply prevail. There was no point in fighting\u2014on our side or theirs.

Some of the picks were ridiculous (The Bible?), and some a little heavy-handed (*The Prince*?). I guess my problem with lists like these is that they are so long and sprawling. What do I do when I read them all? Grow a beard and barbecue a pig? What's the end goal?\n\nI think these sorts of lists should be smaller and less preachy. So what I am going to do is share a list of books that profoundly influence me as the human being, adult, and man I am. My goal is to share some good stuff. Hopefully people read this, get into these books and writers, and are touched by these stories and ideas. One of my professors said we read fiction to learn how to live better, which is kinda corny but also a little true. So here is my list. Trying not to go too far into summaries. \n\n1. *Fight Club* by Chuck Palahniuk. Tough lead here. It's a book that's as much about alienation as it is about machismo and nihilism. It's scary that many of us in the early throes of adulthood are lost in the sense that we hit a certain age, get a diploma and/or a job, and stop and say \"now what? Is this what the rest of my life is going to be?\" Tyler Durden is like the manic pixie dreambro, an agent of chaos who can save the world by breaking it, or so he has you convinced. This is a book that speaks to the disenchantment of my generation, built to reach the stars only to graduate into a much colder world, and the thing about *Fight Club* is that it shows how badly insecure people want an answer, any answer. \n\n2. *Ask the Dust* by John Fante. Arturo Bandini is a young man in his early 20s trying to make it as a writer in LA in the 1930's. It's so easy to relate to him, because as a narrator, he's so candid. He makes his guilt, shame, pride, ego, failure, success all so palpable that it's like I'm right there beside him. It's a good counter to *Fight Club* because it's less cynical, more hopeful, and yet cripplingly tragic in a very soft-spoken way (read the book and that will make sense). This is the second in the \"Bandini Quartet,\" four novels featuring Fante's alter ego. You don't need to read the first for any context here--they all stand alone very well. What's the book about? The reality of chasing one's dreams. \n\n3. *East of Eden* by John Steinbeck. I really wanted to avoid the run of the mill classics here, because duh, if you are a reader, you should read the classics. This book transcends a classic. It's about fathers and sons, heroes and whores. It's a tome, but it really picks up steam about 200 pages in, and it's so gripping. It's about growing old, and family, and trying to make things right, pride, honor--it's got so much important stuff, and Steinbeck can be subtle, I love the man, but he has no problem hitting you over the head in this one from time to time. \n\n4. [\"Winter Dreams\"](http://www.gutenberg.net.au/fsf/WINTER-DREAMS.txt) by F. Scott Fitzgerald. This is a short story, and I linked to a crummy PDF. Heart wrenching tale about love. This is one of the stories he wrote while he tried out a bunch of the Gatsby ideas. It's a growing up sort of story. \n\n5. *Sirens of Titan* by Kurt Vonnegut. I love me some Vonnegut. He's so very good. This is one that falls outside of his \"classics.\" He fools around with time being a set single line, Tralfamadorians, and his general absurdist take on everyday life. This is a novel about hope, failure, loss, and redemption. A man (and his dog) who has come unstuck from time figures out a way to save the world and humanity. It's Vonnegut's second novel, and I think it's his best, but I also think all of his stuff is incredible. \n\nSo that's my list. There's lost more, but those are 5 good ones. I don't pretend to say these are some definitive texts. Just really good ones that I like and have inspired me. \n\nHappy reading. \n\nEDIT: I am glad this post has taken off a bit. Keep sharing these poignant novels and stories.

I released it for free as a thank you to the Python community in general. You can view that [here](https://www.slitherintopython.com).\n\nThe feedback was amazing (thank you all, I'm delighted you enjoyed it!). It inspired me to write another book that I felt was the natural extension to it - focusing on data structures and algorithms. In fact, I had a lot of requests for it after the last two chapters of that book so that inspired me even more to write this.\n\nI had started on it a while back but work became super busy and last year happened so I kind of forgot about it. However I recently came across the files and decided to pick it back up.\n\nIt's now complete: \"Slither into Data Structures and Algorithms: A concise guide to the backbone of the digital world through Python\" and you can check it out here: [slitherintoalgorithms.com](https://slitherintoalgorithms.com).\n\nThe chapter on Graphs is up and free to read on the site! Again, I'd like to thank everyone on this subreddit that gave such amazing feedback and improvements for my last book.\n\nEDIT: Thank you for the awards!\n\nEDIT: It's been pointed out a couple of times so I'll address it here. On a second look, the title of this post may be a bit misleading, unfortunately I can't change the title. This book is NOT free. I've kept the cost of it as low as possible and is a fraction of the cost of other books on this topic. However, with the hosting, SSL and domain costs for both this new book and the beginners book (which is free), it is unsustainable for me to release this one for free too.

Source code, pictures, and results! [Source code](https://github.com/tstewart161/Reddit_Sentiment_Trader)\n\n[Hosted version](https://getquantbase.com) (how to actually run/invest in it). Folks the amount of y\u2019all that have messaged me asking for this is absolutely AMAZING but I can\u2019t keep up! Posting the link here for you guys\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHOW I DID THIS\n\nScraped WSB sentiment, got the top + most positively mentioned stocks on WSB (for the better part of this year, that's been $GME and $AMC, recently some $SPCE and $NVDA, and about 13 other stocks. I have the strategy rebalancing monthly. The source code is actually pretty intuitive, but essentially what it uses is VADER ( Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning), which s a model used for text sentiment analysis that is sensitive to both polarity (positive/negative) and intensity (strength) of emotion.\n\nThe way it works is by relying on a dictionary that maps lexical (aka word-based) features to emotion intensities -- these are known as sentiment scores. The overall sentiment score of a comment/post is achieved by summing up the intensity of each word in the text.\n\nIn some ways, it's easy: words like \u2018love\u2019, \u2018enjoy\u2019, \u2018happy\u2019, \u2018like\u2019 all convey a positive sentiment. Also VADER is smart enough to understand the basic context of these words, such as \u201cdid not love\u201d as a negative statement. It also understands the emphasis of capitalization and punctuation, such as \u201cENJOY\u201d which is pretty cool. Phrases like \u201cThe acting was good , but the movie could have been better\u201d have sentiments in both polarities, which makes this kind of analysis tricky -- essentially w VADER you would analyze which part of the sentiment here is more intense.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Results and some stats:**\n\nRight now I'm up 60% YTD, compared to the SP500's 13% (the recent spikes in GME and AMC have helped tremendously)\n\n\\- The strategy is **backtested** only to the beginning of 2020, but I'm working on it. It's got an annualized return of 33% (compared to 16% for the SP500)\n\n\\- **Max drawdown of -8.7%** (aka how far it went down before coming back up -- interestingly enough, WallStreetBets weathered COVID pretty well)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHappy to answer any more questions about the process/results.

It was at the beginning of my senior year in college, I came across [this post in Askreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/xufi3/i_can_hear_music_for_the_first_time_ever_what/) after seeing it linked on Facebook. I went to high school with the author, I think he was a year or two above me. That\u2019s not important though.\n\nWhat is important is that I read his post and I saw all the replies, especially this part of the thread where /u/GiraffeKiller tells him to start in the 1950s and work his way through the decades to which /u/_pH_ responds basically stating that if he starts then, he misses the entire jazz age. \n\nWhen I read this I realized just how set in my ways I was musically, mainly listening to the same 40-60 songs, pieces and soundtracks. \n\nReading /u/deafstoryteller\u2019s post and those two comments and I realized that a man who, until that point in time, had never understood or appreciated music was undergoing the experience of a lifetime. He was listening to all these songs for the very first time. \n\nNow, I may not be able to magically forget a song like *Bohemian Rhapsody* so I can listen to it for the first time again, but I figured I could do the next best thing and choose a starting point which I could begin my own musical journey. \n\nThe key was figuring out where to begin. Starting anywhere in the 1900s would mean I miss a lot of musical foundations and at the same time, starting in the 1800s would mean skipping a lot of influential musical evolution. \n\nSo I started at the beginning and set out to listen to everything I could find chronologically. I found Wikipedia\u2019s table of years in music, went to 2nd Millennium BC and listened to the Hurrian Song from the 2nd Millennium BC. \n\nNow I\u2019ve just hit 1900. \n\nBehind me has been a slew of fantastic music, from Handel\u2019s Messiah and Alessandro Grandi\u2019s plorabo die ac note to Mozart\u2019s *Eine kleine Nachtmusik* and Luigi Boccherini\u2019s *String Quintet in E Major.* From Charles Wesley\u2019s *Soldiers of Christ, Arise* to Stephen Foster\u2019s *My Old Kentucky Home* to Gilbert and Sullivan\u2019s *HMS Pinafore.*\n\nIt\u2019s taken me four years to get this far and in those four years, I\u2019ve seen music go from something that could only be enjoyed by the high class upper crust of society to something even the common man can enjoy.\n\nFurther, what\u2019s been a pretty straightforward evolutionary journey is about to explode into every possible direction stylistically and I\u2019m looking forward to every minute of it. \n\nI might post what really stands out to me too.  \n\n--EDIT--\n\nMany have expressed their interest in a playlist with the pieces and songs that have really stood out to me. During the Baroque era and early classical era, I had started a playlist and as I kept going, I started posting what I really enjoyed to Facebook. \n\nGive me a few weeks and I'll consolidate them into a single playlist.

It's amazing and kind of confusing, but crazy none the less.\n\nRecently I had to integrate Python as a scripting language into a large c++ project and though I should get to know the language first. And let me tell you, it's simply magical.\n\n\"I can add properties to classes dynamically? And delete them?\" \"Functions don't even care about the number of arguments?\" \"Need to do something? There's a library for that.\"\n\nIt's absolutely crazy. And I love it. I have to be honest, the most amazing about this is how easy it is to embed.\n\nI could give Python the project's memory allocator and the interpreter immediately uses the main memory pool of the project. I could redirect the interpreter's stdout / stderr channels to the project as well. Extending the language and exposing c++ functions are a breeze.\n\nPython essentially supercharges c++.\n\nNow, I'm not going to change my preference of c/c++ any time soon, but I just had to make a post about how nicely Python works as a scripting language in a c++ project.

Like, their *unnamed* grudge causes fights to break out in the streets, causes deaths of people who have nothing to do with their grudge. You could make the argument that the fact that no one can name what caused this animosity, that it must not have even been so terrible, and they are holding onto it all out of pride.\n\nRomeo is introduced to us by saying how he wants to *kill himself* because his romance with Rosaline ended, then immediately falls in love with the first cute chick he sees that same night, implying that he falls in love easily- that he is more in love with being in love than anything else. This is further exemplified by the fact that, unlike with many of Shakespeare's couples in other plays, we really don't get a chance to see either Romeo and Juliet as individuals with their own personalities other than \"in love\". Romeo, what about Juliet do you love so much other than her appearance? Anything? Wit? Kindness? Determination? What, other than appearance, makes her worthy of your obsession? He never takes the time to praise anything other than her surface qualities.\n\nRomeo allows his obsession to shut down any thought of the potential consequences in eloping with Juliet. This is seen by how cluelessly he responds to Tybalt on encountering him, post marriage. He doesn't even behave rationally, just thinking: Well, I love Juliet and she loves you, therefore we're buds now.\n\nAs for Tybalt, his failure is giving in to blind rage, provoking a fight between himself and Romeo, which results in Tybalt's death.\n\nMercutio is pissed cuz he knew all of this needless fighting and death was based on these two families being made up of absolute drama queens all worked up over some straight-up bullshit and that *none of this had to be this way,* but because Romeo is his himbo friend he goes ahead and gets murked trying to keep his buddy from killing himself. This is why he dies like: \"For the record, you guys' families are toxic af. Bleeehhhhh...\"\n\nFinally, if Romeo had given a moment to think about *anything at all* in the crypt (self-reflection, analyzing the damage this family grudge has done to everyone, commentary on the crypt's interior decor) rather than *immediately making decisions based on his powerful emotions* neither Romeo nor Juliet would have died.\n\nStop teaching Romeo and Juliet as a romance. Especially to teens. Teens are *often* influenced by their emotions into making knee-jerk decisions that they often come to regret or have dangerous consequences. They *need* to hear the allegory as it was intended to be taken.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: no, I didn't *just* realize this. I am frustrated because as a librarian that works with teens, I have heard this is how it's being taught to them, and when I was in high school I was also taught to interpret it as a sad love story about true love. I am frustrated to hear that it is still being taught this way by at least some teachers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit edit: I did not add the spoiler tag. No clue why it's there, but meh.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit the 3rd: Some of you guys are thinking I see this as my raison d'etre or that I'm rabidly angry about this, but really it's just an annoyance. I ended up really liking Shakespeare in college but the way Romeo and Juliet was taught to me in high school had left me feeling frustrated and angry and I just assumed it was because I must not like Shakespeare. So I missed out on really enjoying his works for years because I assumed that my frustration was with Shakespeare's work, rather than my teacher's interpretation of it.

I've become a musician myself because it's the only way I can express my emotions. I can't talk to anyone about losing someone like Chester. They treat it like another stupid celebrity death. Living Things (one of L.P's most recent albums) helped me cope with the idea of dying and it being absolute. My dad and I spent a lot time blaring Linkin Park playing video games.

The discoveries and innovations are progressing at a dazzling rate, much of this lead by researchers at universities in the USA.  At these universities, a substantial amount of the work is done by graduate students, who work long hours (80 hours weeks aren't unusual) for little pay.  These graduate students go on to work in good paying jobs, where their innovations make more jobs for others.  \n\n\nStart-ups develop to bring new innovations based on the skills graduate students learn (Google was the project of a couple of Stanford grad students, even Reddit benefited from the skills of a physics grad student/PhD, /u/keysersosa, the current CTO.)  Grad school has been for decades a path to prosperity for  those who come from humble beginnings but are willing to work hard, and make sacrifices, a system that has greatly benefited all of us.\n\n\nThis is why we scientists are shocked and appalled by the recently passed tax bill in congress which will result in the tax bills of already poor grad students [going up by as much as 300%](http://fortune.com/2017/11/08/graduate-students-say-gop-tax-plan-could-increase-their-taxes-by-nearly-300/), which would see their take-home pay drop by 25%. As a former grad student myself, I can tell you that I would not have been able to continue if my pay had be reduced by $7,000, and many students would make the same conclusion.  Instead, some will not go into science or they will leave the USA to be a grad student in Europe or Asia, most of these students will never return to the USA. \n\n\nThis is why every major science organization has [voiced opposition to the current tax plan](https://www.aaas.org/sites/default/files/AAAS%20Multisociety%20Letter%20on%20Tax%20Reform.pdf?D1fnCM0H.C.qegz_Yo2wJwPV7IWBzuGy), make no mistake, this plan will [undermine research and eventually the economy of the USA](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-017-05925-6).\n\nIn comic form from [PhD Comics](http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1985).\n\n\nWhat can we do to stop it?

Which books would you consider a perfect 10/10 in your eyes? It doesn't matter if it's a popular classic or if it's an underrated gem that feels like only you've read it, please just share with me the books you consider perfect and maybe a little reason why you think so. Feel free to post one book or multiple books.\n\nFor me, the books I consider perfect are Les Miserables, Don Quixote, Watership Down and The Iliad (there's bound to be more but for the time being these are the ones that pop into my head).\n\nLes Miserables - it's tragic but also immensely life-affirming. You can't help but love Jean Valjean: for every wrong he does, he attempts to right it and throughout his life he sticks by that ethic even when it's the most difficult thing to do. There's so many characters that intertwine and interact with each other that it's hard not to fall for some of the relationships in this book too, especially Marius and Eponine. They're both clearly underdogs that were meant to be together but life just has its ways of complicating things.\n\nDon Quixote - it's incredibly funny, with plenty of little jokes directly from Cervantes that criticises the author of an unauthorised sequel of Don Quixote that was published before Cervantes could finish the second volume of his novel. Don Quixote is both a fool and a genius. It's hard not to admire his constant determination to succeed even if his attempts are doomed to fail (the obvious example is the windmill charge but that's such a small segment of the large book: I loved the part where he confuses two flocks of sheep as two warring factions and decides to try and help both).\n\nWatership Down - a beautiful look at environmental concerns, dictatorships, folklore and religion through the adventure of a group of rabbits in search of a new home. The adventure is full of intricacies such as stories of the great rabbit El-Ahrairah, the black rabbit of Inle, the social and gender roles of the rabbits, communication amongst different species, etc. Also that ending is going to stick with you. Very excited about the BBC series coming this December.\n\nThe Iliad - a little slow to start (but understandable as the ship catalog and soldier registry is almost like Homer's way of name-dropping the names of people in the audiences he used to orate to as well as their family members that were in the military) but once this beast of an epic poem gets going, it doesn't slow down. The violence is unflinching (two ways of tasting copper!) and it's full of Greek Gods throwing shade; soldiers' trash talking; interior politics and manipulation from both the soldiers and Gods; and an incredible tragedy (I won't spoil how the book ends for those unfamiliar with Greek mythology and The Iliad but even if you are aware of what happens, reading how it develops to that point in The Iliad is haunting and it still lingers with me a year after having read it).\n\nTL;DR: which books do you consider perfect 10/10s? Not just the books you really like, but the books that don't seem to do any wrong at all!"}, {"subreddit": "politics", "label": 7, "post": "Trump Offered Assange Pardon if He Covered Up Russian Hack, Court Hears "}, {"subreddit": "gaming", "label": 3, "post": "The perfect casting doesn't ex...

I wanted to share something I have been working on for years. I know its not much, but its a playlist I have been personally putting together for the past 4 years. Each song I stumbled upon has made me feel some type of emotion. It's become a love letter to lo-fi music lovers with a sprinkle of other genres. Its not meant to be played on shuffle. Instead just hit play. I painstakingly try to find a flow between songs that fit together and transition into another song.\n\nI hope everyone enjoys it.

I really am blown away. There are a lot of questions and I have been reading every single one of them.\n\nFirstly, I want to thank everyone for listening to what little playlist I put together over the years. I know its small in comparison to the other playlists out there that has more exposure or better selection of music. Seeing so many comments and thank yous from everyone really cheered me up this morning and even made me cry. Yeah, I'm an emotional wreck, but I just never even considered people would find what I put so much time into to be worth listening to.\n\nHere is a little origin story to it all. The playlist started back in 2014. 2014 was probably the hardest year for me. Nothing ever went right and some inner demons that was manifesting in ways that made me feel all out of sorts. I've always dealt with depression for years and music plus video games has always been the coping method of choice for me. It was like a gateway out of everything. It helped me escape my thoughts. At my lowest I had thought about things I did as a kid. Instead of being a social butterfly, I was usually in my room and listening to the radio and fumbling with old worn out cassette tapes trying to record songs off the radio that I liked and matched together-- struggling to wait out advertisements between songs. So to calm me down, I decided to do the same thing digitally with Spotify. Hence this playlist \"Thoughtful\" was created. I revisit this playlist from time to time to add, take away, put back, and reposition songs with a fresh set of ears. Its tedious, but I want it all to flow continuously without being jarring. Its like a little hobby of mine. One method I stick to is: Never add more than 1 to 2 songs per artist at max and never full albums. If people had ever found my playlist, I wanted them  to get a taste of an artist and become curious enough about them to search them and listen to more.  Every song, I have listened to multiple times and found the perfect order (for me at least) to sew and stitch them in.\n\nAs for technical issues. I'm not a computer expert so I don't know why the playlist won't open for some users. I never used iTunes or Google Music, I wish I could help.Here are a few more links if its useful:\n\n* Spotify URI - spotify:user:liltommytom:playlist:27sXUC59n6RUV7f02nA1xC\n* Actual http link: [https://open.spotify.com/user/liltommytom/playlist/27sXUC59n6RUV7f02nA1xC?si=6ZsJfv6NTh-d-cMycG2g4Q](https://open.spotify.com/user/liltommytom/playlist/27sXUC59n6RUV7f02nA1xC?si=6ZsJfv6NTh-d-cMycG2g4Q)\n* My Spotify Profile Link [https://open.spotify.com/user/liltommytom?si=UzgcpuL\\_SwGZO6rtIT\\_G6g](https://open.spotify.com/user/liltommytom?si=UzgcpuL_SwGZO6rtIT_G6g)\n\nAlso thank you to whomever gave me a reddit gold!

The greatest problem when looking for implementations of network packet sniffers in Python 3 is that nearly all of them rely heavily in third-party libraries like Scapy or kamene that, though very convenient, may not be at hand when an ethical hacking engagement has to take place in restrictive environments.\n\nFor this reason I implemented this basic packet sniffer using just built-in libraries and fully compatible with Python 3.x. It is implemented in OOP, leverages libraries like ctypes, socket, argparse and others and relies on the use of abstract base classes, inheritance, special methods, decorators and design patterns (command, observer and  template). We also employ some manipulation of binary and hexadecimal values that are formatted for the use on raw sockets.\n\nThis tool is part of an upcoming (though not nearly ready) series of video tutorials I plan to launch some time in the next year. It might be a rather long course given how much we'd need to cover about all the underlying networking and programming topics.\n\nIt's available on GitHub.

I'd like to take this opportunity to share some lesser known non-album tracks so that those who miss him or Linkin Park can have \"new\" music to listen to. Through the nearly 2 decades that Chester Bennington was in Linkin Park, a lot of music got made. A lot of that music never made it onto an official album release. Instead, a great majority were released on yearly discs for the LP fan club, known as the LP Underground. Some still were released through various other means. Below, in roughly chronological order, are finished (in most cases) tracks that a non-hardcore fan may not have heard before:  \n  \n**Slip (circa 1999)**  \n[Slip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkbrrvzsUF4) originate from when Linkin Park were known as Xero, pre-Chester. The song was redone once Chester joined the band. This demo was eventually released on LPU11 in 2011.  \n  \n**Blue (circa 1999)**  \n[Blue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4xH8UZo9qA) is a song that the band largely considered crap. They would end up recording it, but abandoned almost all of it later. The bridge, however, the band actually liked. They took the vocals from that section, and with new words and new chords underneath, created the chorus to Hybrid Theory hit Crawling. Blue would also see release on LPU11 in 2011.  \n  \n**So Far Away (circa 1999)**  \n[So Far Away](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgV2BaKChuU) is the earliest instance of rapper/guitarist/pianist/bassist/producer Mike Shinoda singing on lead vocals, almost a decade before he would do so on Minutes to Midnight. The chorus is interesting in that it has Mike singing with Chester almost rapping his lines in a call-and-response manner, a reversal of the formula that brought Linkin Park to fame. So Far Away was released to fans on LPU12 in 2012.  \n\n**Dedicated (circa 1999)**  \n[Dedicated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4NVy0oPtR8) is a rap-centric track written by Mike leading into the Hybrid Theory sessions. A few interesting facts on this one: the version of Dedicated that was released is censored, with the word \"shit\" being muted. This is the only version of the song that exists for public consumption. Further, Dedicated would be sampled in future collaboration with legendary DJ group The X-Ecutioners on It's Goin' Down. Dedicated was released in 2002 on LPU2.  \n  \n**Step Up (circa 1999)**  \n[Step Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYoLCNvQtf8) is a rap song that originates from the Hybrid Theory EP from 1999. At this point in the band's career, Hybrid Theory was the name of the band rather than Linkin Park. This would end up changing as there was an existing band named Hybrid. Chester would recommend the name Lincoln Park to the rest of the band as he passed a park by that name on his way to the studio every day. This EP was released in very limited numbers in 1999, but was eventually rereleased in 2001 for the LPU, technically making it LPU1. Step Up was a popular song to be played live by the band throughout their nu-metal era. The song would also later be sampled by the band on It's Goin' Down and Reanimation track Kyur4 Th Ich.  \n  \n**And One, Carousel, and Part of Me (circa 1999)**  \n[And One](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB4yACNasqE), [Carousel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtPay1Ubk-Q), and [Part of Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C29XoZeAwE8) are also songs from the Hybrid Theory EP. Unlike Step Up, however, the band would keep these songs in consideration for their debut album, rerecording them and adding parts through the Hybrid Theory recording sessions. Interestingly, since these are demos for the ALBUM Hybrid Theory but also got an official release on the Hybrid Theory EP the year earlier, you get an interesting scenario where the \"demo versions\" of these three songs are actually more recent than the \"official releases.\" I've linked the demo versions in this post. These were included in demo CDs to get word out about the band. Speaking of demo CDs...\n  \n**She Couldn't (circa 1999)**  \n[She Couldn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OYeXDryPCs) was a track found on a Hybrid Theory demo CD. It's a clear indicator that, even as they were developing their breakout nu-metal sound, Linkin Park were willing to experiment with drastically different sounds. She Couldn't is softer, vocally, than anything that could be heard at this point from Chester, and featured a sparse guitar lead and a synth breakdown. It was included on an 8-track demo to distribute for internal use or as promo material. She Couldn't holds the distinction of being one of the longer songs Linkin Park has ever written, clocking in over 5 minutes in length. This would not be beat by a non-remix track until 2006. As it stands, the only songs that clock in at a longer duration by the band are The Little Things Give You Away off Minutes to Midnight, The Catalyst off A Thousand Suns, Guilty All the Same off The Hunting Party, and A Line in the Sand off the same album. This song did not see official release, presumably due to sampling B-Boy Document '99 by High & Mighty. You might know THAT track from Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2. She Couldn't went undiscovered by Linkin Park fans until copies of this promo CD showed up on eBay in 2009.   \n  \n**Regarding 1999 Demo CDS: The above demo CDs also include early demo versions of songs like In The End, Crawling, A Place For My Head, and Points of Authority that end up on the Hybrid Theory album. Some of them are vastly different than the version we got. I'm not going to write them up here since they ended up on a studio album, but feel free to go listen to them yourself!**  \n  \n**QWERTY (circa 2006)**  \n[QWERTY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP-8qFJ7pZo) was written and recorded during the sessions for Minutes to Midnight. It came about due to the band wanting to debut a new song for their shows in Japan in 2006. The band had actually been planning to play a song with the working title Grecian, but last minute decided to scrap it and write a new song instead. Thus, QWERTY was born. After the Japan shows in August, the band would record the song and release it on LPU6 that December.  \n  \n**Chance of Rain (circa 2006)**  \n[Chance of Rain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgTMlOQ3bks) is one of many tracks that did not make the cut for 2007 album Minutes to Midnight. It's on the mellow side of what Linkin Park were producing in this period. Mike Shinoda stated that the song did not make the cut due to the band feeling like there were too many mid-tempo songs being considered for the album, like Leave Out All The Rest, In Between, or Valentine's Day. Chance of Rain was released on LPU15 in 2015.  \n\n**Across The Line (circa 2007)**  \n[Across The Line](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9MrdsuQfNE) is another song that did not make the cut for 2007 album Minutes to Midnight. Under the working title Japan, this song can be heard being demoed out in the accompanying DVD for that album. It holds the distinction of being the last song to be cut from the album of all the songs that were recorded during this period. Across The Line was released to the LP Underground on LPU9.  \n  \n**Blackbirds (circa 2007)**  \n[Blackbirds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrDe3ATl5I) is yet another song that did not make the cut for Minutes to Midnight. This song made it far enough into the recording process to have orchestral strings arranged by David Campbell recorded for them. The song was \"released\" as part of Linkin Park mobile game 8-Bit Rebellion! (sic) in 2010.  \n  \n**No Roads Left (circa 2007)**  \n[No Roads Left](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mchhPf81iw) is, you guessed it, a song that was cut from Minutes to Midnight. This is probably the most well-known of this batch, as it was a bonus track on some editions of that album. Recording of this song can be seen in the Making of Minutes to Midnight DVD, where Chester and Mike tell the story of how Chester insisted that Mike's voice was better for the song.  \n  \n**What We Don't Know (circa 2007)**  \n[What We Don't Know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VE9t74VmUyA) is, well, look at the year and figure it out. Despite reaching the mixing stage of the album recordings (it was mixed by Neal Avron, who mixed the entirety of Minutes to Midnight), the song is considered unfinished by the band. What We Don't Know was released on LPUX in 2010.  \n  \n**Pretend To Be (circa 2006-2008)**  \n[Pretend To Be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z51GGSBv9Bg) began as a song from the Minutes To Midnight recording sessions, but would be reworked and re-recorded in 2008. The song has a rarity for LP tracks, an instrumental breakdown outro that reduces to drum and bass before building back up. Pretend To Be was released on LPUX in 2010.  \n  \n**I Have Not Begun (circa 2009)**  \n[I Have Not Begun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zy3ybFruYRE) is a Mike Shinoda-centric rap song that was recorded during the sessions for album A Thousand Suns. The track was built around recordings of Mike creating a static buzz by touching a gauge cable with his finger while plugged into an amp. I Have Not Begun was released on LPUX in 2010.  \n  \n**Not Alone (circa 2006-2010)**  \n[Not Alone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbL1s9qwBs) originates from the Minutes to Midnight sessions. It was untouched for a few years until the catastrophic earthquake that hit Haiti in 2010. The band, who runs the charity Music For Relief, worked with other artists to create the compilation album Download to Donate for Haiti. People were encouraged to either download the compilation with proceeds going to relief efforts, or to donate to relief efforts. Other artists who contributed to this album were Slash, Peter Gabriel, Alanis Morissette, Dinosaur Jr., and more. The album was released in January 2010 and raised $270,000.  \n   \n**Primo (circa 2010)**  \n[Primo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6mbMmunQa8) was a song that began during recording sessions for 2010 album A Thousand Suns. It would later be reworked into [I'll Be Gone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1wM5ljye28), a song featured on 2012 album Living Things. Among the hardcore LP fanbase, Primo is considered to be highly superior to I'll Be Gone. This demo would see release in 2013 on LPUXIII.  \n  \n**The Last Line (circa 2007-2014)**  \n[The Last Line](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4uiBKDkS690) began as a demo titled \"Ammosick\" during the Minutes to Midnight recordings. Vocally, it is a Mike Shinoda-centric song and definitely has elements that date it to those 2007 sessions. Despite not being considered for that album (though it reached the mixing stage of that album), the song idea would persist with the band, as evidenced from their Meeting Of A Thousand Suns documentary. At one point, a song board can be seen with titles of songs being considered/worked on, including The Last Line. The song would be used by Linkin Park's DJ, Joe Hahn's directorial debut Mall. While The Last Line is credited as Ammosick in the film, the official soundtrack release that came in 2014 finalizes the title.  \n  \n**Devil's Drop (circa 2011-2014)**  \n[Devil's Drop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EnkwS_M6Nc) was created during the recording sessions for 2012 album Living Things. Like The Last Line, it features Mike Shinoda taking lead vocals and playing the guitar loop that forms the basis of the song. The guitar loop was recorded on an iPhone so that Mike would not forget it, and thus features background chatter from the rest of the band. Devil's Drop was also released in 2014 for the Mall soundtrack.  \n  \n**It Goes Through (circa 2011-2014)**  \n[It Goes Through](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjGdzDj9qXc) is another song from the batch of Living Things demos that end up on the Mall soundtrack. Like the other two songs we've seen from this soundtrack, the song is largely Mike Shinoda on vocals, though Chester is (along with the other two) credit as a writer.  \n  \n**White Noise (circa 2012-2014)**  \n[White Noise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlitEk_pJt0) is the sole Chester-centric song off the Mall soundtrack. Not much is known about the origins of this one. As it was recorded for Mall, it existed in some for at least by 2012. The lyrics of the song can be seen in YouTube videos documenting the launch of 2014 album The Hunting Party. Fittingly for that album's style, White Noise has a dirtier, guitar-based instrumental than the other 3 Mall songs. It would be released for free download by Linkin Park in 2014.  \n  \n**What Are You Worth (circa 2016)**  \nWhat Are You Worth is a demo from the One More Light sessions. It is a Mike-centric song, and is decidely more rock-focused than other songs from those sessions. What Are You Worth was leaked to the public in 2019. There is no link for this song largely because it was not meant for release and I would like respect the band and label's wishes to not share this song.  \n  \n**Looking For An Answer (circa 2017)**  \n[Looking For An Answer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=labrkIEGxyA) is, as of today, the last song written for/under the name of Linkin Park. This song does not exist in album form, and was written by Mike Shinoda after Chester passed away. It was performed at the Celebrate Life memorial concert for Chester.  \n  \nI hope everyone is doing well today. Thank you for sticking around through this whole post, and I hope you found some new Linkin Park songs to enjoy, even if they are old."}, {"subreddit": "gaming", "label": 3, "post": "Opening Steam "}, {"subreddit": "politics", "label": 7, "post": "'Tweeting at the TV doesn't fix things': Obama mocks Trump's record in rousing campaign speech "}, {"subreddit": "music", "label": 6, "post": "Rick Astley - Better Now (Post Malone Cover) [Hip-Hop] "}, {"subreddit": "science", "label": 2, "post": "Social distancing and mask wearing to reduce the spread of COVID-19 have also protected against many other diseases, including influenza and respiratory syncytial virus.

Hullo people of r/books I'm Neil Gaiman and I write stuff. Mostly, I write stories.

And because I love stories, I also love to talk about the ways that we, the people who build stories, make up our glorious lies in order to tell people true things about their lives and the worlds they live in. Stories save our lives, sometimes. The ones we read, and the ones we write. I love making stories, whether as short stories or novels, graphic novels or screenplays. I love sharing the craft of storytelling, love teaching and explaining. It's why I teach, when I can. But I can't teach as often as I would like, or talk to as many people as I would want to. That was why I embraced the idea of teaching a MasterClass. So...now I\u2019m here on Reddit to chat with you about the MasterClass I've made on the art and the craft of storytelling. And because this is an AMA, I'm expecting questions about my novels, comics, television, films, wife, porridge recipes and the airspeed velocity of unladen swallows.

My god, what a mistake. If this post can deter anybody from going and spending money in this country, it served its purpose. I\u2019ve never been anywhere where the general population was so misogynistic and disrespectful to women, you are completely and blatantly lied to and ripped off by everyone - regardless of how \u201csavvy\u201d of a traveler you think you are, and when you\u2019re not dealing with that you are still battling constant food poisoning irrespective of eating in the higher end hotels (sofitel, Marriott, etc). The joke is truly on the tourists who choose to come here. Want to go to the Pyramids? Prepare to get harassed and tricked into getting on a dying horse that is beaten and whipped to keep moving. Then cornered for everything in your wallet. Want to see Luxor temple or Karnak? Make sure you don\u2019t go into any corners or tight spots the people \u201cworking\u201d there will block you and make you pay them. Sharm El Sheikh? If you are a diver than it\u2019s a must see, everything else including the hotel is an absolute ruin. Think it\u2019s cheap? Speak English and your prices are pinged to the dollar. Even the doctor at the sofitel in Cairo will charge you $300 for a covid test. I consider myself a savvy traveler and I have been all over the middle east. This is the worst place I have ever been to and if you are a North American (of any ethnicity) I highly recommend you pick another destination. A real tragedy for 50% of Egyptians who are nice people, because the other 50% have ruined the country.\n\nEDIT: Thank you for all your posts and let\u2019s please be respectful of all religions including Islam, which has many modern and peaceful followers. Not all people are like this. Like I have pointed out I have been to many countries in the middle east including Azerbaijan, Lebanon, U.A.E, and others. Also, there is a difference between women receiving interest and kind remarks from men and flat out child abuse and harassment. Let us recognize the difference. Turkey is not this bad. This post is very specific to Egypt and applies to Egypt only. Thank you\n\nEDIT 2: Due to comments and DM\u2019s I will add that I am a certified diver and even the PADI shop in Sharm El Sheikh was awful and obsessed with trying to sell me a dive master package, which I did not have time for. The manager was a total asshole and was yelling at me for everything on the dives. I paid 200 euros for a 3 dive package and I had to carry all my equipment and setup everything myself (BCD, regulators, etc). I have never had to do that anywhere else in the world. 2 of my tanks had 140 bar instead of 200 (no refund lol), no lunch served on boat, ripped off my underwater photographer at end of day. You truly cannot get away from the BS in this country. My recommendation for divers is to fly directly into Sharm El Sheikh and go on a fully inclusive 2-3 day overnight boat, then get the hell out.

Sorry if gushy posts about how a book made me cry aren't allowed, but Jesus Christ man. \n\nI knew what Lolita was before I read it. I knew it was about a sick, evil man \"falling in love\" with a little girl and taking advantage of her after her mother dies. But I think going into the book with this knowledge actually made it MORE difficult to come to terms with. \n\nI hated Humbert. He's evil, he's deranged, and I wanted to feel happy when he died. But I couldn't. When he killed Clare Quilty and drove recklessly, covered in his blood, so detached from anything, I cried. I hate Humbert, and the book was so wonderfully written that I actually empathized with him, and I was lowkey disgusted with myself for it. I know he's the epitome of an unreliable narrator and that he spends the duration of his confession lying to himself and the reader, but I actually caught myself feeling sorry for him. He's a deranged man, destroyed by an obsession that drove him to destroy the lives of others. \n\nBut then I realized... I was falling for Humbert's trap. That is what Humbert WANTED me to feel. He made me feel his suffering, his fear, his pain so deeply that I nearly forgot about Dolores, the real victim of the story. He destroyed her. He completely destroyed her and I was almost too blinded by Humbert's misery to see it, and yet it's plain as day. When he was killing Clare, I caught myself feeling like Humbert was a man, hopelessly in love, destroyed by that love, and he had that love torn from him and was left with nothing. Humbert wanted the reader to feel that way. \n\nHumbert didn't love Dolores. He loved the idea of her. He was so obsessed with his sick idea of \"nymphets\" that he completely forgot that they were just kids. He was so obsessed with Dolores, put her on such a high pedestal that he completely forgot that she was a person, a HUMAN BEING who he utterly destroyed. And I was so blinded by the tale of a man losing himself in insanity, to the point where I was crying because I FELT SORRY for this miserable sack of shit, that I too forgot for a moment that Dolores was a person, a child, and she was the one who was actually the victim in all of this. That probably sounds insane to anyone who hasn't read the book and that's because it is. Dolores lost her mother, her friends, her innocence, her WHOLE LIFE and it was old poor Humbert that I caught myself crying for. \n\nVladimir Nabokov, you brilliant bastard."}, {"subreddit": "travel", "label": 9, "post": "Plaza de Espa\u00f1a, Sevilla "}, {"subreddit": "technology", "label": 5, "post": "Elon Musk Beats Out Mark Zuckerburg, Steve Jobs As The Most Admired Tech Leader "}, {"subreddit": "books", "label": 4, "post": "Harriett\u2019s Bookshop owner hands out free books about black leaders during Philly marches "}, {"subreddit": "gaming", "label": 3, "post": "Press F to pay your respects "}, {"subreddit": "python", "label": 1, "post": "Started learning python today, Screw 'Hello World' , I'll start with 'Hello There' "}, {"subreddit": "science", "label": 2, "post": "Supervisors with \u2018bottom-line mentality\u2019 driven by profits to the exclusion of caring about other outcomes, like employee well-being, environment or ethics, could be hurting their bottom lines by losing the respect of their employees, who counter by withholding performance, according to a new study.

But in the last couple of years we've started reading chapter books, and I'm getting to share with her some of my FAVORITE stories, and it's the most incredible experience.\n\n\nWe read the first few Harry Potter books 3 times, because she always wanted to start again when we were finished. Each time she convinced me to read a couple books farther, until this year when we finally finished the series. I know there's a lot of content that she can't fully comprehend, but just sharing the story with her and seeing her get so into it (she was Hermione for Halloween 2 years in a row) is amazing. We've also read Ella Enchanted twice, one of my all-time favorite books from when I was a kid, and when we finished it the last time she said \"That is my FAVORITE book!\"\u00a0\n\n\nThe books I'm reading with her were such a big part of my life, for years and years before she was even born. When we read them together it feels like we're creating a special bond that is separate from other parts of our mother-daughter relationship.

I'd like to take this opportunity to share some of his covers, collaborations, and non-Linkin Park work for those who want to hear \"new\" music with his unmistakable voice. 2 years ago today, I did a [write-up of non-album Linkin Park tracks](https://old.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/cfnuab/chester_bennington_passed_away_2_years_ago_today/) for those who wanted to hear some \"new\" Linkin Park that they might not have heard before. In that post, I discussed doing another post of collaborations, covers, and non-Linkin Park work that Chester had done.  \n  \nIt's late, but here it is. While I'm sure I missed a bunch, I hope this will suffice. \n  \n**Please note:** To make this list a manageable one, I've restricted it to being only efforts where Chester was involved. I could make a whole other post of collaborations and non-LP stuff that Mike Shinoda has done on his own.  \n\n###1993-1998: Pre-Linkin Park Bands  \n[Sean Dowdell and His Friends?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdQro4nM-JE) was a short-lived band formed in 1993. They recorded a three-track cassette, which has been linked. The band played around 50-70 shows around Phoenix before the band broke up, due in part to Chester constantly being late to practice.  \n  \nAfter that break-up, Sean Dowdell would start a new band named Grey Daze with Jonathan Krause, employing Chester Bennington once again as vocalist. The band put out two records: [Wake Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQOf3DU2gq4&list=PL8Wqgys3W3nY_3SjoC_1sTKX1ZGq0Rd0Z), which came out in 1994, and [...no sun today](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2O5BQxOAS0) which came out in 1997. The band found minor success, but after receiving no meaningful looks or calls from major label executives after doing showcases in California, they eventually broke up.  \n  \n**Personal Recommendation:** [What's In The Eye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrVmdmKXyVw) off of ...no sun today  \n  \n###2001-2002: Hybrid Theory Live Covers and Guest Appearances  \n\nFast forward to 2001, and Linkin Park is in full tour mode. At this point, the band had one album out and, depending on where they were playing, either needed to pull earlier songs out (these were gone over in further detail in my post linked above) or play covers. In the early part of 2001, Bennington would do an acoustic rendition of [**Jane Says by Jane's Addiction**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpnwX62OGow) to start encores, although this cover was dropped after 5 shows. Infamously while vamping for some time after a song at Rock Am Ring, the group jokingly went into a 30-second cover of [Sweet Child o' Mine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw_rcG8Lt_Y) by Guns N' Roses, the headlining band at the festival.\n\nDuring the 2001\tFamily Values tour, Bennington would get to join Stone Temple Pilots on stage for a few songs. One such guest appearance, [Wonderful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVi3wlbSn1M), was recorded and placed on the Family Values live album. Chester was also known to come out and perform [Dead & Bloated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Sw4slu5mPE) with the band, trading vocals with Scott Weiland. This would be interesting foreshadowing for later in Chester's career.  \n  \nHe also joined Disturbed on stage during Ozzfest to perform [Pantera's Walk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7-3QfgSfYE) several times.\n  \nIn late 2001, Chester would again do an acoustic rendition of a song during a Linkin Park encore. This song was an original of his, titled [Morning After](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-H55HEYKI8), would eventually become a song for his side project Dead By Sunrise 8 years later.  \n  \nIn 2002, Linkin Park would lead their very first headlining tour named **Projekt Revolution.** For this string of shows, the band added a cover song full-time to the set, [My Own Summer (Shove It) by The Deftones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wixN4-5WIGU). During this song, Mike Shinoda would often try (and many times fail) to get the crowd to yell the \"shove its\" during the chorus while Chester screamed himself crazy.  \n  \n###2001-2002: Studio Collaborations/Appearances  \n  \nIn 2001, DJ Lethal of Limp Bizkit fame was working on a solo album. While the project was pushed back many years and eventually shelved, we did get snippets and eventually a full web release of his track featuring Chester. The track went under the working title \"State of the Art\" before finally becoming [Cry To Yourself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0q1-9zYpSUc).  \n\nIn 2002, Chester would lend his vocals to two tracks. One was the track [Karma Killer by Cyclefly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umPkis99iMI). Cyclefly toured with Linkin Park several times, both in the US and in Europe. Another one of Linkin Park's touring friends, Korn, would be the source of the second track. The Queen of the Damned soundtrack was written and performed by Korn's lead vocalist Jonathan Davis. However, his contract with Sony prohibited him from singing on the album (although his voice can be heard singing the soundtrack in the movie). To get around this, guest vocalists were brought in to perform the songs originally sung by Davis. Of these tracks, Chester sang [System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De4MX7lLaio), the third track on the record.\n  \n2002's **Reanimation** occurs in this timespan as well, but being a very popular remix album (the 4th best-selling remix album of all time, in fact), we will move in.  \n  \n###2003-2005: Meteora Era\n\nIn 2004 during their European tour, Linkin Park started playing a cover of Nine Inch Nails' track [Wish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLheapeGk10). This would be a regular addition to the set for the rest of the year, even warranting inclusion on one of the band's fan club Linkin Park Underground albums. An uncensored version of this release can be found [here (please note the video portion of this is identical to the previous link, only the audio is different.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JNV-5g_OGY). Also in 2004, Dan the Automator (of Gorillaz, Deltron 3030, and Kool Keith production fame) and Prince Paul (of De La Soul and countless other production fame)'s project Handsome Boy Modeling School released their second album. The feature guest look is unapologetically insane. RZA, Pharrell Williams, El-P, comedian Tim Meadows, Jack Johnson, The Mars Volta, Mike Patton, John Oates of Hall & Oates, Linkin Park, and more. The track Linkin Park featured in was [Rock and Roll (Could Never Hip Hop Like This) Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJITcTBaV6Q) and was comprised of four movements similar to the Four Seasons by Vivaldi, which is heavily sampled. Mike Shinoda raps in the second movement, while Chester sings in the fourth. It should be noted that a fan remix of Chester's section is often misattributed under the name \"Hardly Breathe\".  \n  \n2004 ends with the very highly regarded EP Collision Course, a mash-up EP of Linkin Park and Jay-Z. Meant to be the first in a series of MTV-sponsored mash-up albums, Collision Course ended up being the only effort in the \"series.\"  \n  \n2005 would see three studio collaborations for Chester. The first is a track by DJ Z-Trip entitled [Walking Dead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJfrDV2_5W8) off Z-Trip debut album Shifting Gears. The second would be guest vocals on Nine Inch Nails' Head Like A Hole by Korn for a cover album titled Korn Kovers. This never saw release, but has been discussed by members of Korn as recently as last year. It has since become the Chinese Democracy of nu-metal albums. The third was a recording of [Home Sweet Home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BTifMm6ejA) by Chester and original artists M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce to benefit the victims of Hurricane Katrina.\n\nSpeaking of Hurricane Katrina charity benefits, the second Chester Bennington original song, [Let Down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpSr65SPzCg), debuted live at ReAct Now: Music & Relief on cable television. However now the side project had a name, Snow White Tan, and was known to include members of the band Orgy as a supporting cast.\n\n###2006-2008: Rap, Weeds, and Sadness  \n  \nOver the next 3 years, Chester would be recruited for guest vocals on a handful of rap tracks. Interestingly, the first would be a live performance by Linkin Park co-member Mike Shinoda's project Fort Minor. In 2006, both Fort Minor and Linkin Park were scheduled to play Japanese festival Summer Sonic. Fort Minor's hit song Where'd You Go would get a live performance in 2006 with [Chester taking lead on the chorus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7A0dWgjhw8). In 2007 Chester lent his vocals to another chorus, this time in the studio for at-the-time G-Unit member Young Buck, on the track [Slow Ya Roll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIjQRqtYnps). The last track in this span is Busta Rhymes' 2008 track [We Made it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYxzRYMrcVc), which would lead to the two touring together under the Projekt Revolution banner before Busta was dropped by his label, necessitating him to drop out of touring as well.  \n  \nNow, for the sadness: That 2008 Projekt Revolution tour also had Chris Cornell on the bill. Chris at the time was touring in support of his Timbaland-produced solo album Scream. Throughout this time, Chris would perform Temple of the Dog track [Hunger Strike](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOKYyTRSO5A) with Chester joining in. Temple of the Dog was a project Chris Cornell made with the surviving members of Mother Love Bone after their lead singer died of an overdose. It should also be pointed out that July 20th, the day Chester died by suicide, is also Chris Cornell's birthday. So yeah. Sadness. I'm sorry.  \n  \nThere's a better version of [Hunger Strike](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3NFsI2mJDE) available, I just wanted to link a version that had concert footage.  \n  \nDuring this tour, Chester would also join touring band Ashes Divide to perform a rendition of [A Perfect Circle's The Outsider.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RqZSENSNRs)  \n  \nAnd as a palette cleanser, Linkin Park did a very short cover of the track [Little Boxes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WHrmybJ5Ro), most well-known for being the theme song to Showtime's Weeds. Season 3, which aired in 2007, had a cavalcade of artists covering the track for each episode. Other artists to join in this include Ben Folds, Death Cab for Cutie, Elvis Costello, Rise Against, and Regina Spektor.  \n  \n###2006-2012: Camp Freddy  \n  \nCamp Freddy was an all-star cover band with a revolving door of people jumping in for random cover songs of their friends, or even their own band. The most constant members of the band were Dave Navarro of Jane's Addiction, Matt Sorum of Guns N' Roses, Billy Morrison of Billy Idol, and Chris Chaney of Jane's Addiction and Alanis Morissette's band.  \n  \nExamples of revolving guests? Slash of Guns N' Roses fame, Chad Smith of the Chili Peppers, Corey Taylor of Slipknot, Ozzy Osbourne, Lana Del Rey, Brandon Boyd of Incubus, and, of course, Chester Bennington. Here is a list of some of the songs I've been able to find of Chester performing with Camp Freddy.  \n\n- [AC/DC's Highway To Hell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKw1uPQpE70) with Slash  \n- [Run DMC and Aerosmith's Walk This Way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2kh6wtuhiE) with Mike Shinoda  \n- [Smashing Pumpkins' Bullet With Butterfly Wings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-lJN4JI1-s)  \n- [Led Zeppelin's Whole Lotta Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuBW992uUQk) with Slash and Joe Satriani  \n- [Guns N' Roses' Paradise City](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kirIrSTHJoA) with Slash and Duff McKagan.  \n- [Live's I Alone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIEVMwJs6rg) with Travis Barker  \n- [Alice Cooper's I'm Eighteen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMXu0IwHwcA)\n- [Jane's Addiction's Mountain Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ncia7y9h4ew)  \n- [Mot\u00f6rhead's Ace of Spades](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWXMhv67NYk)  \n- [Bob Dylan's Like A Rolling Stone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z5eWmF3peE)  \n- [Beastie Boys' Fight For Your Right (To Party)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y1EQijCnDo) with Mike Shinoda\n  \nAnd, while not related to Camp Freddy (or even a full song), I felt this needed to be included. In 2006, Chester would get on stage with a band named Metal Skool and perform a cover of Dio's [Rainbow in the Dark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05vKInsg90). This band would later change their name to Steel Panther. This is the only clip that apparently exists of this appearance.  \n    \n###2007-2009: Dead By Sunrise  \n  \nChester began working on his solo project in earnest, with the members of Orgy that played alongside him for the Hurricane Katrina relief concert. These musicians would form the band Julien-K, who toured under Linkin Park in 2007. As such, Bennington would frequently join them on stage for their songs [Technical Difficulties](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jVXtRbJ8oI) and [Kick the Bass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMaeTnqOwwY). Ironically, it's the latter song that has technical difficulties, and that's the only version of this live rendition that exists online.  \n  \nChester's solo project, now known as Dead By Sunrise would release their debut (and only) album, [Out of Ashes](https://open.spotify.com/album/34Zz8qH5QJgD2uTXDuZ2J9?si=CUJH7vf9QkyzsGPe71kjIQ&dl_branch=1) in 2009. The album includes studio versions of previously mentioned songs like Let Down and Morning After, with the latter being a [bonus track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlwCU9G-eFc) for the Japanese release of the album. In 2018, demo versions of half the songs were found on a [restrict release watermarked CD](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRCZGc7dsxZnCsld6i5GJWem_xyh3Ngja) that was released by fansite LPLive. This CD also includes a cover of 20 Eyes by The Misfits.  \n  \n**Personal Recommendations for Out of Ashes:** Fire, Let Down, Give Me Your Name, Walking in Circles, In the Darkness. Honestly, everything on Out of Ashes except for My Suffering and Condemned.  \n**Personal Recommendations for Demo CD:** The demo of My Suffering is a HUGE recommend. It's so much better than the album version. Also, the cover of 20 Eyes.  \n  \n###2010-2012: Covers\n  \nThe next few years were defined by covers. In 2010, Bennington would lend his vocals to Santana's cover of [Riders On The Storm by The Doors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYxWF-A2zq4). This was part of a cover album titled Guitar heaven: The Greatest Guitar Classics of All Time and featured guests like Chris Cornell, Yo-Yo Ma, Pat Monahan of Train, and Nas.  \n  \nThe covers would continue in the form of Linkin Park's live shows. In 2011, the band would go viral with their performance of [Adele's Rolling in the Deep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHtwZ07N1ic) at the iTunes Festival becoming a radio hit in the UK. In 2012, the band would incorporate a portion of [Sabotage by the Beastie Boys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqQ1HiKLRc8) into their live shows in honor of the (at the time) recently departed MCA. Generally, they would put it into the bridge of their closer Bleed It Out.  \n  \n###2013-2015: Stone Temple Pilots  \n  \nThe story that began with Chester's guest appearances with Stone Temple Pilots in 2001 comes full circle in 2013, when he joined the band as their lead vocalist. In interviews predating this, Bennington had stated that being a member of STP was a lifelong dream. An EP named [High Rise](https://open.spotify.com/album/61XZkrTQMo602r1e5rgRka?si=nllU1hblQeWfNKfpMtukiA&dl_branch=1) was released by the group and they would tour proper for a few years, before Chester left the band due to Linkin Park commitments.  \n  \n**Personal Recommendations:** Out Of Time, Same On The Inside, Tomorrow  \n  \n###2013-2017: Carpool Karaoke, Steve Aoki, Lonely Island\n  \nIn 2013, Linkin Park would begin a music partnership with EDM artist Steve Aoki. The first track to come out of this is [A Light That Never Comes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsKQOm_iJug), which falls more on the Linkin Park side, musically. This track would be included in Recharged, Linkin Park's remix album for Living Things. The second track in this partnership comes out in 2015 and is named [Darker Than Blood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPtxGC95LxE). As hinted at by my first sentence, this track would fall more on the Aoki side of the spectrum.  \n  \nAfter a string of successful viral hits, The Lonely Island made a movie in 2016 titled Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping. One of the tracks, [Things In My Jeep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LJ3aYw8Brs), were made featuring Bennington and Shinoda. While the version in the movie does not include their contributions, the album version of the song in full includes Bennington's chorus, complete with back-up screams.  \n  \nIn 2017, Chester, Mike, and Joe Hahn of Linkin Park would join Ken Jeong for an episode of Carpool Karaoke. While it was delayed due to Chester's death, the episode was [eventually released on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=2040457085969998). It includes the group singing [Hey Ya by Outkast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlSM3Gt03LQ), [Under The Bridge by Red Hot Chili Peppers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUZPzmicP0Y), Sweet Home Alabama, and I Don't Wanna Miss A Thing.  \n  \nYeah, it's all really silly stuff. But sometimes you just need silly stuff.  \n  \n###2017: Jane Says  \n  \nAt the beginning of the post, I shared an old acoustic rendition of Chester performing Jane Says by Jane's Addiction. It seems fitting, then, that we wrap up with [Chester performing the song again in May of 2017.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_5i63cK-vY) In this video he is showing off the new guitar he had purchased that would becoming his touring guitar for the One More Light tour. Comparing the two versions of the cover is like a night and day experience. I highly recommend going back to listen to that first version before playing this one.  \n  \n###The Morning After  \n  \nThe years following his death would see a small trickle of music relating to Chester Bennington come out. Most notably, Mark Morton of Lamb of God released [Cross Off](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv8oTQWaxwc), which Chester on lead vocals, in 2019.  \n  \nIn 2020, Sean Dowdell and company would dust off, remaster, and add new instrumentals to old Grey Daze tracks and release the remix album [Amends](https://open.spotify.com/album/67HpukNc3CzJhqYneGVim6?si=5vYlT7JpQTe4D8YzEsN74g&dl_branch=1).  \n  \nAnd this year, Slash previewed a snippet of a track called [Crazy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRlbimg1UT8) that featured Chester but was not used for his solo album due to label issues. The track eventually became Doctor Alibi, which was a collaboration with Lemmy of Mot\u00f6rhead. Per Slash, it is up to the Bennington estate as to whether they want to release Crazy.  \n  \n**And that's it for this post.** I hope you had a good time going through a little bit of history and listening to some music today. I'm thinking next year I will do a similar post for **Chris Cornell** as my username, after all, is a portmanteau of my two vocal heroes: \"Fell on Black Days\" being a Soundgarden track and \"Grey Daze\" obviously being Chester's old band.

Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egoism. Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us. Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance. Orwell feared we would become a captive culture. Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture, preoccupied with some equivalent of the feelies, the orgy porgy, and the centrifugal bumblepuppy.\n\nIn short, Orwell feared that what we hate will ruin us.

Quite the learned individual aren't I.' and I sometimes go into a fuckin weird inner monologue that ends with a David Mitchel rant 'words don't really exist do they, they're just a collection of squiggly lines that someone gave meaning to...look at how stupid that one looks'.\n\nIt sounds a bit amusing but it's really fuckin frustrating.\n\nThen there's the ambience of the room and external distractions, the discomfort of holding the book open, my itchy ass, not wanting to crease the spine of the book too much blah blah...

What can I say. Its actually GOOD!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(Personal Bias) Its in the format I like.  I prefer blog post summaries to extended scientific debates.  I enjoy short stories over novels.    Its easier to make a small decent quality meal vs a four course entree which ends up boring you. I can put this down and go to something else rather easily. This book is not a 4 hour course at a specialty cruise.  It's a row of specialty snacks...loosely arranged in the order it wants you to partake in them. You have quite a bit of personal choice in how you want to read this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe short stories are engaging and have a nice personal touch to them.    The wide variety of individuals with different jobs, backgrounds, and personalities have actually reminded me of the book \"Working\" by Studs Terkel.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe best stories are, of course, about the people not involved with the military(At least, during the initial spreading outbreak).  Zombie stories are best done like survivalist stories. That way you can make the behavior of the people actually believable and gripping!  Quite a few of the military stories involve absolutely idiotic behavior and planning.  Mindless zombies with no strategy have no real hope of taking on an organized military...so the only way to make them win is to give the commanders severe mental deficits.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnce you forget about the above...the stories are well written!    Humans turn into cannibals.  Humans bring their gamecubes they cannot play to remind them of home life perks.   People get saved.  I \"liked\" the story of the Martin Shkreli pharma guy who made the fake zombie vaccine and raked in millions.  People gradually turn into metaphorical monsters in order to fend off material monsters. A trope, but one which at least makes sense. Oh, and the \"individual outpost\" military stories are actually also well done.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOh, and it has its cheery moments too! People reminding others to stay alive and upbeat.  People going back risking themselves to save others.  After the \"victory\" life seems to go back to normal...albeit a vastly reduced population and quite different architectural standards to ward off zombies. I would love to see a drawup of the new \"anti-zombie\" architecture ubiquitous in every city.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne of the few 5/5 fictional books I have read in quite awhile! If you didn't know in advance that the Zombie genre simply has never done the \"military vs initial outbreak\" successfully you may rank it lower.  Instead, you simply have to take that as a given. Engage your suspension of disbelief for some key common and necessary tropes and this \\*actually\\* ends up fairly realistic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere is a nice quote.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"In the beginning everyone was friendly. We cooperated. We traded or even bought what we needed from other families. Money was still worth something. Everyone thought the banks would be reopening soon. Whenever Mom and Dad would go looking for food, they\u2019d always leave me with a neighbor. I had this little survival radio, the kind you cranked for power, so we could listen to the news every night. It was all stories of the pullout, army units leaving people stranded. We\u2019d listen with our road map of the United States, pointing to the cities and towns where the reports were coming from. I\u2019d sit on Dad\u2019s lap. \u201cSee,\u201d he\u2019d say, \u201cthey didn\u2019t get out in time. They weren\u2019t smart like us.\u201d He\u2019d try to force a smile. For a little while, I thought he was right. But after the first month, when the food started running out, and the days got colder and darker, people started getting mean. There were no more communal fires, no more cookouts or singing. The camp became a mess, nobody picking up their trash anymore. A couple times I stepped in human shit.

Great book 1, but the writer is obsessed with making it a trilogy, because that's what so many other writers are doing. So you get a book 2 were very little of note actually happens. The writer needs to fill up space so it can become a proper trilogy. And it's nothing like book 1 which you loved so much. But then book 3 is all fire and lighting, because everything gets squeezed into it for a climactic ending.\n\nThere is no shame in having a series be 2 books. And if you have a story that has so much to tell it needs to be 3 or more books, by all means. Just don't make it a trilogy for the sake of it being a trilogy, because readers will notice very fast that it actually shouldn't be 3 books content-wise."}, {"subreddit": "gaming", "label": 3, "post": "A golf game for people who hate golf! - Worked on it for two years "}, {"subreddit": "travel", "label": 9, "post": "Our hotel view in agua calientes, Peru "}, {"subreddit": "sports", "label": 8, "post": "MMA Fighter perfectly times opponents spinning attack with a spinning elbow of his own "}, {"subreddit": "politics", "label": 7, "post": "Obama: If Republicans really cared about Clinton's emails they would be 'up in arms' over Trump's iPhone "}, {"subreddit": "python", "label": 1, "post": "Automating Zoom with Python - automatically logs into one's meetings/classes on time "}, {"subreddit": "books", "label": 4, "post": "Dune by Frank Herbert was AMAZING I finally have power again after 4 days of a dark house due to Hurricane Michael. For three of those days I sat on my porch and read Dune until it got dark and then I lay in bed with a flashlight on my chest reading away. Dune is one of the greatest books I've ever read. Paul having to go through all that after his father's death and realizing his part in this prophecy that has to come true was just astounding. The Fremen are the coolest sci-fi people ever, the way most of Arrakis underestimates them and how they survive on that awful planet is so cool. I really thought it was funny that the Atreides came from Caladan this planet with such an abundance of water to a desert planet where water is the most precious resource you can obtain. The Stillsuits are the coolest thing ever too. The way everyone analyzes eachother in italics is a really cool way to write. The major importance of spice and its impact on the universe is wild. The politics, betrayals, and the enemies' pov's were so interesting. My only real let down was the ending, dont get me wrong the big assault on the Emperor's ship was awesome but the way the book just says Paul's son is dead and not showing us and how he gets the Emperor's Court to come to the old Atreides palace just to kill Feyd-Rautha and demand the Princess Irulan, I just thought the book could of had more there. Another thing that let me down was Paul in the end becoming almost a monster and nothing like the way his father ruled, his own mother was afraid of him and she was a badass; also Gurney not getting to kill a Harkonnen was a bit unsatisfying. All these things made the book all the more interesting and I loved them but they were still a little disappointing. This book and all the interesting aspects, like still suits, Mentats, the Bene Gesserit, the Makers, will always be apart of my mind. I'm now going to move onto Dune Messiah and Children of Dune and I have no clue what I'm getting into. I'd like to know what some of you guys thought of Dune."}, {"subreddit": "politics", "label": 7, "post": "Bernie Sanders: \u201cPresident Trump is a socialist, too, but here\u2019s the difference: The difference between my socialism and Trump\u2019s socialism is I believe the government should help working families, not billionaires.\u201d "}, {"subreddit": "gaming", "label": 3, "post": "Someone remade Podracer with Unreal Engine 4 "}, {"subreddit": "travel", "label": 9, "post": "Montserrat absolutely took my breath away "}, {"subreddit": "entertainment", "label": 0, "post": "Rob Lowe Thanks His Family as He Celebrates 31 Years of Sobriety "}, {"subreddit": "sports", "label": 8, "post": "Amazing hockey play "}, {"subreddit": "science", "label": 2, "post": "Many important antibiotics, like penicillin, are produced by fungi.

Comcast's data cap policy is a flawed consumer control measure against those who would go without cable and a direct action against companies that have actually innovated over the past decade rather than sit pretty on a monopoly. \n\n**Why this is flawed:**\n\n\n**There is no guarantee of accuracy or transparency:**\n\nRegardless of your stance on the matter there should be no argument that internet usage amounts should be accurate and transparent to users affected by it. However that is not the case at all, there is no third party government agency in charge of regulating broadband metering. Comcast contracts out its metering to a third party vendor and its methods of measurement are internal and not open to the public at all. Just this year alone Comcast has received [thirteen thousand complaints about their data caps and their terrible accuracy in measurement](https://www.dslreports.com/shownews/The-FCC-Has-Received-13000-Complaints-About-Comcast-Data-Caps-135895).  Almost everyone who has to deal with this caps seems to have a story of their ISP charging them for data usage that would be impossible given their current bandwidth. \n\n**Discourages cord cutting and stifles competition:** \n\nData caps exist solely as a consumer control measure to stifle competition and cause users to be biased against applications based on the data amount they use. For example [Netflix which lists high quality HD as using 3 GB per hour and Ultra HD as using 7gb per hour](https://help.netflix.com/en/node/87) is immediately affected by this. As Ultra HD becomes more common and using 7gb of data for an hour of video streaming becomes common place users affected by data caps will hit their limits more easily causing them to be charged overages. This will cause users to drop Netflix in favor of less data intensive services which Comcast will only be too happy to provide through cable. Families of five living in a home with heavy Netflix usage will already be pushing this current limit.\n\nThis isn't just for videos of course, people who use services like Steam will be hit just as hard especially as the size of games increases, data intensive services that would have otherwise been developed will languish on the vine as data caps cause consumers to be biased against them.  \n\n**Users have little choice in what ISP they must subscribe to:**\n\nThe Internet is no longer a luxury that most can live without. For many it has become an essential utility much like electricity.\n\nIn any thread regarding complaints against Comcast or any ISP for that matter the main complaint of users is that they have no choice in their ISP (\"Save us Google Fiber!\"). Those lucky enough to live in major metropolitan areas may be fortunate enough to have the choice of maybe two or more ISPs but for many users the local ISP is the only choice they have which grants that business a monopoly in their area. In a happier world there would be dozens of ISPs each competing with each other and vying for market share so the poor behavior of one company only provides an opportunity for another to gain more customers. Sadly most Americans don't live in that kind of free economic environment. \n\n\n**What we need to do:**\n\nHow do consumers collectively fight this when they have little recourse in their choice of ISP?\nThe FCC is currently investigating data caps as a practice. If we as consumers just accept data caps the FCC will have less reason to crack down so it is imperative that the public puts pressure on the FCC. We're back to the Net Neutrality fight all over again as data caps are just a proxy issue that allows Comcast to achieve the same thing it wanted with its draconian net neutrality rules. \n\nSome users may be currently exempt from data caps but this behavior will absolutely roll down hill to other ISPs once they realize that consumers will accept it. Then you'll have to deal with your own little small town version of Comcast with little recourse. \n\nMuch like the behavior of the last Net Neutrality fight calling the FCC directly has a huge impact. \n\nFCC Complaint Line:1-888-225-5322\n\n[If you can't call directly you can file an online form to register your complaint.](https://consumercomplaints.fcc.gov/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=38824)\n\nLike before we need to raise public awareness of this issue and flood the FCC with our complaints and input so we don't have to deal with a stifled internet. \n\n**EDIT 1:**\nSome users have mentioned that the online forum and phone line isn't working out for them.\nAnother number that you can use to submit a comment or complaint.\n\nFCC Chairman Tom Wheeler: (202) 418-1000\n\nThis was also a number we used to contact in order to urge Tom Wheeler to stand for Net Neutrality once again we can call and urge Mr. Wheeler to stand with the internet once again. However please remember that there are real people on the other side of the line. \n\n\n\n**EDIT 2:**\n\n**If you so choose to give the office of Tom Wheeler((202) 418-1000) or the FCC complaint line(1-888-225-5322) a call here's a handy script you can use. Feel free to add on or improvise on this:**\n\n\"I'm calling FCC Chairman Wheeler to urge him to stand with Internet users and pass strong, loophole-free rules against so called Data Caps. There is no legitimate, technical reason for these data caps. Comcast itself [admitted](https://gizmodo.com/comcast-will-cap-more-peoples-data-because-of-fairness-1740913276) in [internal customer service guidelines that these caps aren\u2019t about network congestion](https://i.imgur.com/quf68FC.jpg). Instead, it claims these data caps are about \u201cfairness,\u201d but the broadband industry continues to see higher revenues and profits with lower costs overall and there\u2019s no argument that these caps are based on any \u201cfair\u201d costs that Internet usage causes. The real reason behind these caps is to protect Comcast\u2019s monopoly over cable TV, making it more expensive for customers to \u201ccut the cord\u201d even if they want to choose other video options. And by exempting only its own online video application from the cap, Comcast gives Stream TV an advantage over all competing online video applications. \"\n\nReplace Comcast with your own local ISP or ISPs in general. \n\n*Script and sources shamelessly lifted from [Battleforthenet](https://www.battleforthenet.com/?title-x-committees=1#top).\n\n\n**EDIT 3:**\n\nThe key to this fight will sadly not be a single set of calls made to the FCC but rather a sustained campaign of public pressure and complaint. Long after this thread's karma decays and it falls off the pages people still need let their voices be heard. There will be more threads in the future to bring attention to this we wont go down without a fight.\n\n   **Points of Contact:**\n\n\nFCC Complaint Line:1-888-225-5322\n\n\nOffice of FCC chairman Tom Wheeler: (202) 418-1000)\n\n\nFCC Fax: 1-866-418-0232\n\n\n\n[FCC Online Complaint Form](https://consumercomplaints.fcc.gov/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=38824)\n\n**Remember to contact your local senator to voice your concerns!**\n\n"}, {"subreddit": "science", "label": 2, "post": "A meteor impact 66 million years ago generated a tsunami-like wave in an inland sea that buried fish, mammals, insects and a dinosaur, the first victims of Earth\u2019s last mass extinction event.

Yes, this is partly in response to the recent *Little Women* post, but more broadly about similar posts I have seen here that always seem to get a lot of attention and praise and many comments I\u2019ve seen over the years. \n\nLike so many other teenage girls in high school, I had to read and relate to 95% male-centric stories written by men. I never questioned why we were reading so many \u201cboy books\u201d because the books were not presented as \"boy books,\" they were just presented as normal literature. The curriculum at my school allowed for just a smidgeon of diversity with *Pride and Prejudice* and *The Scarlet Letter*. This was never seen as an issue; it\u2019s just how it was. I still remember clearly hearing the boys in my small class groaning about having to read a \u201cgirl book\u201d when we started *Pride and Prejudice*. The fact that the author was a woman or the main characters women or some combination of those two facts in the boys\u2019 minds was enough to make them sneer at it. It was mildly annoying then, but deeply infuriating and sad now looking back on it years later. Maybe, just maybe, if some of the great female authors and female-centric stories that have been written throughout history had been a part of our Literature curriculums starting from a young age and this was presented as NORMAL, we wouldn\u2019t have high school boys joking and sneering at having to read a \u201cgirl book.\u201d\n\nYou can see the same scenario when men discover that movies like Mean Girls and Legally Blonde are, in fact, great movies. There was a post like this too recently on the movies subreddit. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I would like a chick flick, but it\u2019s actually really good!\u201d Turns out that women are just people, and stories about them and the things they go through are equally as valid and worthy of being told. What a mind-blowing concept!\n\nThe way these statements are phrased as such delightful revelations makes me cringe, and then I feel sad, and then I feel a bit angry, because on some level, whether subconsciously or consciously, the driving force behind these sentiments and posts is that women are \u201cother.\u201d They are not the standard human, they are not fully-fledged standard human people in the same way that men are, so their stories and stories written by them are a sort of \u201cspecial interest\u201d sub-category of women\u2019s fiction. \u201cGirl books.\u201d \u201cWoman\u2019s book.\u201d \u201cChick-flicks.\u201d \n\nConsider this hypothetical scenario and how utterly ludicrous it sounds to us:\n\n*\u201dAs a middle-aged woman, I didn\u2019t think I would be able to enjoy *Lord of the Flies*. I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be a boy so I didn\u2019t think I could possibly relate to these characters and their struggles, but I actually really enjoyed it! Even though it\u2019s about male characters, I found the story to be really great overall and dealing with deep themes. It\u2019s not just a boy book, it\u2019s great literature!\u201d*\n\nSee? Sounds pretty damn ridiculous, doesn\u2019t it? \n\nGirls and women are perfectly capable of viewing male-authored/male-centric stories as just normal good literature because that is the way it is presented to us from a young age all the way up to older education. This is how we are conditioned (with no real choice in the matter), while boys and men are never forced to view female-authored/female-centric stories the same way. \n\nSo, next time you see on of these posts, I\u2019m not calling for us to be rude and antagonistic to the OPs, because what they are doing is technically good I suppose, but I dislike the way they are wanting a pat on the back and upvotes simply for viewing women\u2019s stories as good valid literature worthy of being read.\n\nIt is sad and disturbing that women continue to be seen as the \u201cother\u201d in fiction, a sub-category separate from the established standard of \u201cgood literature.\u201d \n\nThere is no logical reason other than deeply engrained misogyny in society why a man should be that surprised that *Little Women* is a good book. It\u2019s sold millions of copies, had tons of adaptations, is extremely well-known and deeply beloved by people all over the globe. It should not be that surprising that this \u201cwomen\u2019s book\u201d is in fact, just a good piece of literature regardless of the gender of author or characters. Women are literally just people, and their stories are equally as worthy of being told and read as male stories. We are all part of the same humanity. \n\nThe sentiment of \u201cWow, this isn\u2019t just for women, it\u2019s actually a good story!\u201d carries the not-so-subtle implication that things that are \u201cfor women\u201d are inherently lesser. They are seen as a separate sub-category other than the standard that can sometimes achieve \u201cgreat literature\u201d status despite their femaleness. The surprise expressed by men who find these stories to be great implies that their perception shifted, they believed something about the \u201cwomen\u2019s book\u201d before, and now believe something different having read it.\n\nI am 25 now, so I don't know how things are in high schools nowadays. For anyone who does know, are the English Lit curriculums more balanced now or is it still the vast majority of male author/male story? I'm very curious to know. \n\nI want to hear your thoughts on this matter.\n\nEdit: Huge thank you to the commenters that actually read my post (something that is too much to ask for many people I guess) and understand what I\u2019m saying. This comment from u/SchrodingersHamster is probably buried so I\u2019ll highlight it here: \n\n\u201cRight, I doubt anyone is sorting by new here anymore but SO many people are missing the point of this post.\n\nOP is not \"discouraging\" men from reading women's literature. Read the post again. She is focusing specifically on the idea that, from a man's perpsective, women's literature being good is surprising, so surprising that it warrants a post on how surprising it is. That the expectation that women's literature (and art in general) is so much lesser than men's that it becomes a shock when a man reads it and enjoys it.\n\nIt is NOT OP's responsibility to \"encourage men\" to read women's books. The fact that so many men are unwilling to read women's literature is an issue brought about by patriarchal assumptions that men should be sorting out, not women. Women don't need to hold our hands, guide us to all the great female writers, pat us on the back and give us a gold star when we enjoy it. It is not their responsibility. It is ours as men.\n\nOP should not be praising these men. In fact OP, along with the rest of us, should be criticising these mindsets. We should look at these posts through a critical lens, otherwise how are we supposed to move forward? There are plenty of people on this comment section who would much rather OP kept quiet and that the issue is never highlighted or solved, simply because it might be too upsetting for men to read. If you're a man and that's really how you respond when reading this post, grow up.\u201d"}, {"subreddit": "python", "label": 1, "post": "Enso 2.0 is out!

My initial email was very short: I simply asked for access to python to do some data analysis, computations, etc to help me with my job tasks. \n\nI just sent a follow up email to his response detailing what I am using python for. Maybe there was some miscommunication, but I don't intent on making my python scripts part of job/program where it would become a necessity and need to be maintained by anyone. Python would just be used as a tool to help me with my engineering analysis on projects I am working on and just improve my efficiency overall. So far I have not heard back from him. \n\n\nOur company is very old school, the people, equipment, technologies..."}, {"subreddit": "music", "label": 6, "post": "A Tribe Called Quest enlist Jack White, Andre 3000, Kendrick Lamar for new album "}, {"subreddit": "python", "label": 1, "post": "Made something similar to Apple's Animoji\u2122 using Python "}, {"subreddit": "travel", "label": 9, "post": "Hiked to the top of the Tempe of Apollo in Delphi, Greece.

That's how I've been able to devour book after book. \n\n**Edit: Bc I'm constantly asked, I use the site Goodreads.com to track what I read and its how I made the following graphic below. If you would like to follow me/follow each other on Goodreads, Just PM your profile link and I'll add you :) Although you should know I dont review books on there, I simply use it to track the books I'm reading/want to read but I will gladly follow along to your reviews!**\n\n\n[Here's a link to every book I've read, feel free to ask me about any book in this list if you're on the fence about it.](https://imgur.com/a/sOwySVE) PS: the link works best in browser, not thru a mobile app! \n\n**Science Fiction**: \n\n*The Three Body Problem trilogy, Cixin Liu* -- This trilogy is always getting thrown out whenever asks for a good \"alien\" or \"first contact\" book, for good reason. I dont think any other book(s) goes such in depth when it comes to character development and global politics than these. The books span from the cultural revolution in China, to many centuries in the future. \n\n*Dune, Frank Herbert* -- I dont think I've ever read a sci-fi book so beautifully written. From the dialogue between the characters to everything else. This book was one of those books you enjoy to actually read more for the writing style than the story itself (not that the story was bad, it wasn't) similar to the book Lolita. I loved this book and wish it was longer. \n\n*Extracted Trilogy, RR Haywood* -- This is a time travel trilogy where everything is very easy to follow. Its not one of those mindfuck reads where you have to do extensive mental gymnastics to keep up with the plot. You will immediately fall in love with the characters and their collective humor.\n\n**Fiction**:\n\n*The Goldfinch, Donna Tartt* -- I enjoyed this book more for the characters than the story itself. Boris to this day is still one of my all-time favorite book characters of all time. I dont think this book is as good as Tartt's other novel \"Secret History\", but I enjoyed this one more. The movie is set to come out next month as well!\n\n*The Great Alone, Kristin Hannah* -- This book takes place in the late 70s and is about an abusive Vietnam vet and his family and their quest to \"start fresh\" in Alaska. This is a relatively new book, having been published last year but out of all of the novels I've read, this was one of my favorites. Good character depth and a long timeline of events that dont feel rushed or glossed over. \n\n*The Wind-Up Bird Chronicles, Haruki Murakami* -- This is by far my favorite Murakami book. There's a part in the book where a general is telling a war-time story, those that have already read the book know what I'm talking about. Its one of the best parts of the book and a story within a story that has stuck with me since reading it. If you haven't read Murakami yet, this is a good place to start. \n\n**Non-Fiction**:\n\n*Missoula, Jon Krakauer* -- You probably know Krakauer from Into Thin Air (worth the hype), but in this book he tackles rape, rape allegations and the legal process of rape within Universities, specifically Missoula. This book was very eye opening to me because it delves deeper into victims and their experiences. Before this book, all I knew was what was said on television about rape trials, basically he said she said, and the trials' verdicts. Reading this made me much more sympathetic to victims/accusers. Given the current #MeToo movement and the empowerment of victims to come forward, I think if there's one book you take away from this post, it's this one. \n\n*Tribe, Sebastian Junger* -- This author is the mastermind behind the famous documentary \"Restrepo\" that followed Army soldiers in the dangerous Afghan Korengal valley. In this book he focuses a lot more on returning soldiers, PTSD and how to better understand combat and non-combat veterans. This is a very short read (45mins - 1hr) but you come away with such a better understanding of veterans and their difficulty of readjusting to civilian life.\n\n*Fall and Rise: The Story of 9/11, Mitchell Zuckoff* -- This book on 9/11 focuses less on the actual terrorist actions, and what led to those actions, and more on actual people impacted by 9/11. I have to warn you though, this book is extremely heart-breaking. You learn a lot about victims and their final days, their final actions and final moments of life. It's a gut-wrenching read that gives you a whole new intimate understanding of the suffering that went on that day and the days, weeks and years that followed. I've never cried while reading a book but this book was as close as I ever got to doing so. \n\n*No Place To Hide, Glenn Greenwald* -- Greenwald is the journalist who broke the Snowden/NSA mass surveillance story in 2013. This book covers the events of before, during and after his Snowden meeting in Hong Kong. He also goes into depth of some of the NSA spying tools, how they work and who they target. Its a very digestable book and you dont need to be a computer whiz to understand the programs he lays out. Greenwald is one of my favorite journalists and this book further cemented that for me. \n\n*The Anatomy of Terror, Ali Soufan* -- Soufan is a former counter-terrorism FBI agent who in this book details exactly how radical Islamists think, operate and specifically on the rise of the islamic state in the Middle East after the US invaded Iraq. He also goes deep into the sectarian wars between terror groups themselves (Sunnis vs Shias etc). This book gave me a better understanding of how from nothing in 2009, IS rose to power.\n\n**Science**:\n\n*A Crack In Creation, Jennifer Doudna* -- If you've heard of the gene editing method \"CRISPR\" and the many many medical benefits it can have for humanity, it is because of Jennifer Doudna, the scientist who in 2013 discovered that CRISPR Cas-9 has the ability to edit DNA. This book was really fascinating and very easy to read. You dont need to have an interest in biology or genetic engineering to enjoy the book. This book led me down the DNA subject rabbit hole and I wound up reading books on Paleontology, ancient human DNA from Neanderthals and Denisovans, to evolution and ancient life. If you want to learn more about the benefits of gene editing, this is the book to read. \n\n*The Hidden Reality, Brian Greene* -- Greene is a world-renowned physicist most notably known for String Theory. This book is a layman's introduction into String Theory and the multi-universe theory. Again, you dont need to have an interest in physics to enjoy the book. I have never even taken a physics class before reading this book and deeply enjoyed it. If you like watching youtube videos by PBS Space Time, you'll enjoy this book. Greene does a good job in laying out all the information in a way anyone can understand it. \n\n*Homo Deus, Yuval Noah Harari* -- If you've read Sapiens by this author where he focuses on who we are and how we got here and enjoyed it, then you'll enoy this book that focuses on who we're becoming and where we're going. A bunch of broad subjects are discussed in this book and you'll walk away having digested a bunch of information. He's a historian so we wont dive too deeply into a subject but you'll instead get a broad picture of it. \n\n**History**:\n\n*The Road To Jonestown, Jeff Guinn* -- Before I read this book, I always thought of the Jonestown event as a mass suicide by a bunch of religious cultists following a crazy ass religious/socialist zealot. I remember watching YouTube videos on the event as well and forming my opinion on it from them. But there's just so much more to it. It gives you perspectives from former members, how they were either brainwashed or coerced to remain in the 'Peoples Temple'. How the vast majority of the residents of Jonestown were actually lied to and fooled to going to Guyana to how those that did not commit suicide were either shot or forcibly injected cyanide. A very powerful book with insight on how cults operate.\n\n*The Billion Dollar Spy, David E. Hoffman* -- This book follows Adolf Tolkachev, a soviet engineer turned CIA spy during the cold war. For years he fed military secrets to his handler, secrets that saved the US over a billion dollars earning him his nickname and the title of this book. I had never heard of this man until reading this book but I'm glad I did. The man had massive balls and risked everything to do anything he could to topple the soviet union. \n\n*House To House, SSG. David Bellavia* -- Of all the war related books I've read, this is the most gripping and exhilarating one yet. Its a memoir written by Staff Sergeant David Bellavia that takes place during the height of the Iraqi insurgency in Fallujah. If you read this book, you immediately think \"bullshit, this doesnt even happen in movies, this is obviously fake\" because of how crazy the events in the book are. But they're not only 100% true, but were all captured on film thanks to journalist Michael Ware. It was just a few weeks ago too that the author was awarded the Medal of Honor, the highest military honor in the US, for the actions he took which he laid out in this memoir of his. Great read. \n\n*Man's Search For Meaning, Viktor Frankl* -- Frankl is a psychiatrist who was sent to a concentration camp by the nazis during WW2. He observed and noted the behavior of his fellow prisoners and saw how despite the horrid conditions they lived in, they continued to find meaning in their lives. This book is very powerful and it is also a short read given the book is 2 parts. You can make do with only reading the first part, the second part he does a deeper dive into psychology and logo-therapy. Many people on this sub have recommended this book and its with good merit. This is a powerful book. \n\n\n**Books that live up to the hype**:\n\n*Harry Potter Series, JK Rowling* -- Dont ask me why I like these books. Im a 24 year old dude who could not turn away for one second after picking up these books. I owe an apology to all those kids I mentally judged as a kid because they were really into HP. I thought the allure of these books would be lost on me because of my age but that wasnt the case. If you havent read them yet, you should at least give them a chance. \n\n*A Song Of Ice And Fire, George RR Martin* -- I am very glad that I decided to read these books before starting to watch the HBO series. I loved these books and although it was challenging, for me at least, to get into Martin's writing style where he goes back and forth between characters, it became easier as I read on and started to catch on to the plot and I grew to like the style. I've expressed to my family how much I like this series so I'm looking forward to getting Winds of Winter for my 40th birthday. \n\n*Anything by Kurt Vonnegut* -- I've read about half a dozen of Vonnegut's books and havent been let down by any of them. They're a treasure trove of quotes and analogies. There are those who are contrarians and say he's overrated because of how much hype he gets but dont be turned away by them. He's a good author who deserves 100% of the admiration he gets.\n\n*The Kite Runner & A Thousand Splendid Suns, Khaled Hosseini* -- I read both of these books my senior year in high school and decided to re-read them because I thoroughly enjoyed them back then. They were just as good as I remembered them. Hosseini gets recommended a lot on this sub for tear-jerking books and rightfully so. His books take place or have root in Afghanistan given hes an Afghan native himself and he gives good insight on what it is like coming up as an Afghan youth. Great author.\n\n*Dark Matter, Blake Crouch* -- You probably already read this book for the off chance you havent, you should. Its recommended here religiously for good reason. You get sucked in from page one and the story is very easy to follow. His new book \"Recursion\" is also worth a look if you read Dark Matter and enjoyed it.\n\n**Overall favorite book**:\n\n*East of Eden, John Steinbeck* -- Out of the 250 books I read, I have not enjoyed one more than I have East of Eden. This was a very easy choice to make, about one third into the book I knew I was reading something special. The characters, Steinbeck's way of writing, the story-line, everything. There's a very good chance that no book will ever dethrone this one as my favorite and that makes me a little sad. Nonetheless, I am very glad that I read it. Its a beautiful book that I look forward to re-reading. \n\n\nI should clarify that the above list is just my very humble opinion. I have a certain taste in writing and information that the previous authors knew how to struck. I've included a screenshot to all 250 books I've read at the top of this post, [and here as well](https://imgur.com/a/sOwySVE).

EFF made this easy tool so you can tell your senators. [**Link to EFF's easy tool to tell your senators.**](https://act.eff.org/action/protect-our-speech-and-security-online-reject-the-graham-blumenthal-bill)\n\nWhile  the media and people are distracted with COVID-19, two Senators have  been sneaking through an attack on privacy and online security.\n\nImagine an Internet where the law required every message sent to be  read by government-approved scanning software. Companies that handle  such messages wouldn\u2019t be allowed to securely encrypt them, or they\u2019d  lose  legal protections that allow them to operate.\n\n[Take Action](https://act.eff.org/action/protect-our-speech-and-security-online-reject-the-graham-blumenthal-bill)\n\nThat\u2019s what the Senate Judiciary Committee has proposed and hopes to pass into law. The [so-called EARN IT bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/3398/text), sponsored by Senators Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), will [strip Section 230 protections](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/03/graham-blumenthal-bill-attack-online-speech-and-security)   away from any website that doesn\u2019t follow a list of \u201cbest practices,\u201d   meaning those sites can be sued into bankruptcy. The \u201cbest practices\u201d list will be created by a government commission, headed by Attorney   General Barr, who has made it very clear he would like to ban   encryption, and guarantee law enforcement \u201clegal access\u201d to any digital message.\u00a0This is the next FOSTA - which was disaster for many users and small companies.\n\nThe EARN IT bill had  its first hearing March 12th, and its supporters\u2019  strategy is clear. Because  they didn\u2019t put the word \u201cencryption\u201d in the bill, they\u2019re going to  insist it doesn\u2019t affect encryption.\n\n\u201cThis  bill says nothing about encryption,\u201d co-sponsor Sen. Blumenthal said  at today\u2019s hearing. \u201cHave you found a word in this bill about encryption?\u201d he asked one witness.\n\nIt\u2019s  true that the bill\u2019s authors avoided using that word. But they did propose legislation that enables an all-out assault on encryption.  It would create a 19-person commission that\u2019s completely controlled by  the  Attorney General and law enforcement agencies. And, at the hearing, a Vice-President at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) made it clear \\[[PDF](https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Shehan%20Testimony.pdf)\\]   what he wants the best practices to be. NCMEC believes online services should be made to screen their messages for material that NCMEC considers abusive; use screening technology approved by NCMEC and law   enforcement; report what they find in the messages to NCMEC; and be held legally responsible for the content of messages sent by others.\n\nYou can\u2019t have an Internet where messages are screened en masse, and also have end-to-end encryption any more than you can [create backdoors that can only be used by the good guys](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/05/there-no-middle-ground-encryption). The two are mutually exclusive. Concepts like \u201cclient-side scanning\u201d aren\u2019t a clever route around this; such scanning is [just another way to break end-to-end encryption](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/11/why-adding-client-side-scanning-breaks-end-end-encryption). Either the message remains private to everyone but its recipients, or it\u2019s available to others.\n\nThe  19-person draft commission isn\u2019t any better than the 15-person commission envisioned in an early draft of the bill. It\u2019s completely dominated by law enforcement and allied groups like NCMEC. Not only will those groups have a majority of votes on the commission, but the bill gives Attorney General Barr the power to veto or approve the list of   best practices. Even if other commission members do disagree with law enforcement, Barr\u2019s veto power will put him in a position to strongarm them.\n\nThe Commission won\u2019t be a  body that seriously considers policy; it  will be a vehicle for creating  a law enforcement wish list. Barr has  made clear, [over](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/07/doj-and-fbi-show-no-signs-correcting-past-untruths-their-new-attacks-encryption) and [over](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/12/fancy-new-terms-same-old-backdoors-encryption-debate-2019) again, that breaking encryption is at the top of that wish list. Once   it\u2019s broken, authoritarian regimes around the world will rejoice, as   they have the ability to add their own types of mandatory scanning, not   just for child sexual abuse material but for self-expression that those   governments want to suppress.\u00a0\n\nThe  privacy and security of all users will suffer if U.S. law  enforcement  is able to achieve its dream of breaking encryption.  Senators should  reject the EARN IT bill.\n\n\u00a0\\- Deeplinks Blog | by Joe Mullin | March 12, 2020\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**e: List of Co-Sponsers of the disastrous 'EARN IT' act**\n\nthank you u/Popular-Uprising-\n\n    Sen.

See new thread: http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2q358f/fcc_claims_net_neutrality_comments_were_not_lost/\n\n---\n**Update 7:42pm EST 12/19/2014:** This situation isn't hopeless. Insiders think the FCC will come out with a Title II rule. The hard part will be defending it from a Comcast-captured Congress. That's why it's so bad for us that the FCC botched these numbers; it makes the public look divided, when it's not. What can you do? Write Congress at www.battleforthenet.com, and generally be ready for when shit hits the fan in January/February. We'll need local volunteers in major cities to organize protests & stunts aimed at members of Congress. If you can help, email team@fightforthefuture.org. We're a 501c3 / 501c4 fueled by donations. [Those help too :)](https://donate.fightforthefuture.org)\n\n---\nEarlier this week, Sunlight Foundation [released a study](http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2014/12/16/one-group-dominates-the-second-round-of-net-neutrality-comments/) claiming that anti-Title II comments from a group with ties to the Koch Brothers \u201cdominated\u201d the second round of FCC commenting, beating out comments from pro-net neutrality groups like EFF and Fight for the Future. Now, [anti-net neutrality groups](http://www.americancommitment.org/content/conservatives-opposed-internet-regulation-won-fcc-comment-period-landslide) and [journalists](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/12/18/dirty-data-why-the-4-million-public-comments-on-net-neutrality-might-not-be-what-they-seem/) are seizing on this report to try to make it look like the public is against Title II net neutrality. The problem is, the FCC\u2019s data was missing hundreds of thousands of pro-net neutrality comments, and I can prove it. To make things worse, Sunlight\u2019s study counted every anti-net neutrality comment while systematically ignoring pro-net neutrality comments. It\u2019s a mess.\n\n**Full disclosure:** I\u2019m Jeff Lyon, CTO at Fight for the Future, a pro-net neutrality group responsible for driving 777,364 pro-net neutrality comments through the Battle for the Net campaign. I\u2019m posting this here, along with all of our evidence, with the hope that Reddit can help us verify these claims.\n\n**The FCC data dump was missing hundreds of thousands of pro-net neutrality comments.**\n\nThe raw data [the FCC released](http://www.fcc.gov/blog/fcc-releases-open-internet-reply-comments-public) and that Sunlight used for its study was missing hundreds of thousands of pro-net neutrality comments sent from Battle for the Net. I noticed this and emailed the FCC\u2019s Chief Enterprise Architect, who confirmed via email that, of over 525,000 comments we submitted via CSV, _at least_ 244,811 were missing from the data that the FCC released (**[screenshot of email from FCC](http://s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/fcc_email_redacted.png)**). As of right now, the failure point is still unclear: did the FCC simply fail to export these comments, or did they actually fail to process them in the first place?\n\nWorse, of the comments the FCC _did_ include, Sunlight found that 95,000 of them were duplicates\u2014the same comment showing up multiple times, and this means an additional 95,000 of the unique comments we sent are missing. (I verified we did in fact send unique comments by examining reference numbers attached to them, can\u2019t exactly prove this without violating our privacy policy)\n\nTaking 244,811 + 95,000 gives us _at least_ 339,811 pro-net neutrality comments that are provably missing from the data. This is alone is enough to unseat Sunlight\u2019s (methodologically-flawed) conclusion that anti-net neutrality comments \u201cdominated\u201d the second round, and the total number of missing comments is probably much higher.\n\nSunlight analyzed 1,674,385 comments and determined a 60 / 40 split between anti- / pro-net neutrality comments. They didn\u2019t specify, but if we conservatively assume that 0% of the comments were undecided or ambiguous, then this amounts to 1,004,631 anti-net neutrality and 669,754 comments. Adding in the 339,811 proveably missing pro-net neutrality comments gives us 1,009,565, shifting the dominant group in favor of net neutrality (this margin would be increased if we assumed more than 0% of comments were ambiguous, and if Sunlight\u2019s logic wasn\u2019t completely flawed [more on that soon]).\n\n\n**There are probably many more missing comments.**\n\nThe total number of missing comments is probably much higher than the number I\u2019ve (thus far) identified. To help establish this, it\u2019s useful to examine the different ways that people could submit net neutrality comments to the FCC, as well as the precise approach I used to determine these numbers.\n\nIn the beginning, there was [ECFS](http://apps.fcc.gov/ecfs/comment_search/execute?proceeding=14-28), the FCC\u2019s online commenting system. This system is over a decade old and melted down from the hundreds of thousands of comments sent through Battle for the Net and by fans of [comedian John Oliver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpbOEoRrHyU) during the first round of net neutrality comments. (I believe on good authority that the FCC has just one server running the entire ECFS web site :)\n\nThe FCC soon realized that ECFS wasn\u2019t working, and [started accepting comments by email](http://www.fcc.gov/page/fcc-establishes-new-inbox-open-internet-comments). However in September, right before the second net neutrality commenting deadline, the FCC made it possible to submit comments in bulk using CSV spreadsheets. Given the sheer volume of comments we were collecting through Battle for the Net, this option made the most sense in order to ensure timely delivery to the FCC.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems that CSV option was unreliable. Over half the comments we submitted via CSV were missing from the FCC\u2019s final data, and in Sunlight\u2019s study, no comments were attributed to some other big companies that participated with Battle for the Net and submitted CSV comments on behalf of their users. If the FCC actually failed to process comments from these groups, the total number of pro-net neutrality comments would be even higher.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting, the technique I used to determine the missing CSV comments is simplistic and only establishes a floor, not a ceiling, for the possible total missing. Here\u2019s what I did:\n\n* Battle for the Net submitted 527,952 unique comments via CSV to the FCC between the dates of September 12 and September 15\n* Of these comments, 525,189 contained the phrase \u2018We are writing to urge you to implement\u2019 (people were signing onto an open letter from Senator Angus King)\n* If all of these were counted, we would expect to see at least as many occurrences of that phrase in the [raw data](http://www.fcc.gov/files/ecfs/14-28/R-14-28-02-SOLR-RAW.zip ) released by the FCC, but instead there were only 374,421 occurrences.\n* Of these, 374,421 occurrences, FCC\u2019s Chief Enterprise Architect confirmed via email (**[screenshot of another email from FCC](http://s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/emails.png)**) that 92,645 were from comments submitted through the FCC\u2019s email address, meaning that 281,776 is the maximum number of comments possibly from the CSV files in their data, and they were missing at least 244,811.\n* We only did a basic text search to arise at this number. If other people submitted comments with the phrase \u2018We are writing to urge you to implement\u2019, it would mean that _even less_ of our CSV comments made it into the final data.\n* And of the 374,421 matches that were in the data, Sunlight confirmed that at least 95,000 were duplicate records, meaning that at least another 95,000 of the comments we sent are also missing.\n\nWe still don\u2019t know whether comments submitted via ECFS were properly reflected in the FCC\u2019s data. I\u2019m running a full analysis, comparing our data to theirs, but it will take some time to complete.\n\n**To make things worse, Sunlight\u2019s study counted every anti-net neutrality comment and systematically ignored pro-net neutrality comments**\n\nThe Sunlight Foundation studied the FCC\u2019s data and concluded that comments from net neutrality activists were eclipsed by anti-regulatory comments from American Commitment, a known astroturfing group with ties to the Koch Brothers (they sent paid emails with misleading messages, but that\u2019s [another story](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-conservative-anti-net-neutrality-movement-that-wasnt)). However, Sunlight applied a flawed sampling methodology to a flawed set of data, and drew conclusions that are impossible to make with any \u201creasonably representative\u201d certainty.\n\nIn particular, of the 2.4 million comments released by the FCC, they ignored 800,000 comments that they couldn\u2019t parse, and assumed these comments maintained the same distribution of pro- vs. anti- net neutrality comments. They\u2019ve said the 1.6 million comments they did look at were \u201creasonably representative\u201d of the whole group, but have provided no evidence to support that claim.\n\nI\u2019ve looked at the data myself. It\u2019s extremely inconsistent, with comments in a multitude of formats, some plaintext, some XML, and many simply as concatenated strings with no delimiting characters separating them from one another. It\u2019s generally very difficult to parse. However, it\u2019s extremely easy to pick out and parse the email comments, as they tend to follow a consistent format.\n\nThe group of commenters that \u201cdominated\u201d the second round of comments (in Sunlight\u2019s words) could have simply been the one organization that\u2013due to the technique it used for submitting\u2013didn\u2019t get all its submissions garbled. In fact, it looks like that\u2019s what happened. The FCC counted _all 92,645_ of the comments we sent via email, and failed to parse comments we sent via CSV. On the other hand, _all 777,364_ anti-net neutrality comments from American Commitment were sent via email, present in the FCC\u2019s data, and counted in Sunlight\u2019s study.\n\nWhat this means is that, after Sunlight threw 800,000 comments away, half of their remaining sample pool of 1.6 million comments are easily parseable emails from American Commitment.\n\nIt is erroneous to assume that you can throw away a third of your data and that the distribution of the remaining data will be unaffected. Taking this further, Sunlight has publicly acknowledged a non-trivial difference in how they counted some comments from pro-net neutrality groups like Free Press versus comments from American Commitment.\n\nAll groups were effectively collecting signatures on a letter. American Commitment submitted them as a barrage of identical comments, while groups like Free Press submitted them as signatures on a single letter. The FCC says it recognizes and counts both. But Sunlight Foundation admits they chose to treat them differently, excluding multiple signatures on a single letter from the count.\n\nThis further confounded the result of their study in favor of anti-net neutrality commenters.\n\n**TL;DR:**\n\n* FCC failed to process hundreds of thousands of net neutrality comments\n* Sunlight Foundation based a study on the FCC\u2019s data, counted every anti-net neutrality comment and systematically ignored pro-net neutrality comments. Concluded that anti-net neutrality \u201cdominated\u201d\n* Political pundits and journalists are spinning this to say that the public is against net neutrality\n* I wanted to get the facts out in the hopes that Reddit verify this, further analyze the FCC's data, and help figure out what's going on."}, {"subreddit": "politics", "label": 7, "post": "Calls intensify for resignation of Michigan sheriff who shared stage with militia.

We\u2019ve all heard that liking this novel is a \u201cred flag\u201d and folks seem to talk a lot of shit when men and young boys like this novel especially. I knew this book resonated with some real criminals who enacted awful acts of violence, so I was truly expecting the worst. I was completely shocked by the actual nature of the novel.\n\nAs someone who works with teens/in youth services, I found Holden heartbreaking. He\u2019s a teenager dealing with depression, isolation, and trauma, both from the loss of his brother and, it\u2019s revealed, childhood sexual abuse/sexual assault. After he evades assault from Mr Antolini, he has a panic response and confesses to the reader: \u201cthat kind of stuff's happened to me about twenty times since I was a kid. I can't stand it.\u201d\n\nI feel like all anybody ever speaks about when it comes to Catcher is how annoying/pretentious Holden is - but isn\u2019t this very obviously a trauma response to unspeakable suffering? Catcher in the Rye isn't about Holden being an ethical model to follow- instead, Holden is deeply flawed and poorly adjusted because he has not been given the resources to heal from the trauma he's suffered. The novel\u2019s approach to sexual violence doesn\u2019t even begin and end with Holden - it permeates the novel, from Jane Gallagher (who is being abused by her step-father) to the sex worker Holden meets in the city to the sexual violence/aggression Holden knows his peers enact against other students and girls he knows.\n\nIt\u2019s a really weird \u201cflex\u201d that people think dunking anyone who identifies or likes Holden is impressive. Do people realize that some CSA survivors, especially boys who are far less likely to speak up about their abuse, may see themselves in Holden? Are they aware that finding Holden annoying for whining or being pretentious or jaded or depressed likely perpetuates the idea that the only good victims of abuse are the noble, palatable ones (ie the ones that don\u2019t actually exist outside of movies)? What do y\u2019all think?\n\n**Edit**: **Just to be clear**, **I'm not saying you're not allowed to dislike Holden or Catcher in the Rye**. **I'm talking specifically about the folks who say that anyone who likes the book is toxic or that it's a \"red flag\" to like it or have it on your bookshelves.**"}, {"subreddit": "gaming", "label": 3, "post": "After 28 years I\u2019ve finally done it "}, {"subreddit": "travel", "label": 9, "post": "Always wanted to see the northern lights.

Later that day, XXXTentacion left the room and returned with two grilling implements\u2014a \u201cbarbecue pitchfork\u201d and a \u201cbarbecue cleaner,\u201d she said\u2014and told her to pick between them, because he was going to put one of them in her vagina. She chose the fork. He told her to undress. He was lightly dragging the tool against her inner thigh when she passed out. He did not penetrate her with it.\n\n> \"pinpoint the days he threatened to kill you,\u201d the reported victim responded, \u201cWell, when we lived in Orlando, it was literally like every day.\u201d\n\n> \"And he was asking me why I was singing his friend\u2019s part of the song, if I like him, why do I like him, like do I ever look at his Twitter,\u201d Then, XXXTentacion head-butted her, punched her, stomped on her, and put her in the bathtub, where he continued hitting and kicking her. \u201cHe also wanted to cut out my tongue because I was singing the song,\u201d she said. She tried to run away down the street. He tackled her, causing her head to hit the pavement. She suffered black eyes, a lump on the back of her head, scratch marks, and bruises, including a large bruise on her ankle where he stomped her.\n\n> Also while living in Orlando, he hit her with white plastic clothes hangers. \u201cHe broke a good 30 hangers on my legs,\u201d she said. Around this time, he tried cutting her hair, and he held her head under running water in the bathtub.\n\n> In August (2016), XXXTentacion was arrested in a separate case. (As previously reported, he was charged with armed home invasion, robbery, and aggravated battery with a firearm, stemming from an alleged incident in November 2015.\n\n> He told her he knew she had cheated on him. He put a knife to her neck, strangled her \u201ca little bit,\u201d and called her a \u201cho,\u201d she said. That night, he woke her up and told her to go outside, where he picked up an empty glass beer bottle and demanded that she tell him the truth or, \u201cI\u2019m going to fuck you up.\u201d She replied that she already was telling him the truth, that she had cheated and was sorry. He dropped the bottle, slapped her, and let her go back to bed.\n\n> In two incidents there (Streetwater, Fl), XXXTentacion grabbed her by the neck, strangled her, and forced her down on the bed before another person who lived there came to the rescue.\n\n> After finding out she was pregnant (which she claims was planned by both of them), XXXTentacion called the man she slept with while he was in jail. He then started elbowing, head-butting, and punching her. He strangled her until she almost passed out. He took her to the bathroom and demanded one last time that she tell him everything or he would kill her in the bathtub. She couldn\u2019t even recognize her face in the mirror\u2014it looked \u201cdistorted\u201d\u2014and her left eye was completely shut and \u201cleaking blood.\u201d She was losing vision. She vomited.\n\n> After she requested to go to the hospital, XXXTentacion told her she couldn\u2019t leave until her face had healed, because otherwise the police would be called. They left her in a bedroom, and XXXTentacion confiscated her phone. She didn\u2019t get it back until he was arrested on October 8.\n\n> For the next two days she didn\u2019t leave that room except to use an adjacent bathroom. She couldn\u2019t find a way to flee. There were bars on the windows. \u201cIf you\u2019re smart, you would stay with me until you get a car and you have enough money to move into an apartment,\u201d he told her. \u201cBecause if you leave now, you\u2019re just setting yourself up for failure. You\u2019re going to be homeless.\u201d\n\n> She let him know she was going into the kitchen to make him some food. She opened the refrigerator door wide enough so that he wouldn\u2019t be able to see her if he she crouched down, and then she opened a side door and ran to the nearest main street she knew. She didn\u2019t have any money. She asked someone if she could use their phone and called the only number she knew by heart. It was the number for the ex-boyfriend she had been living with the night she agreed to move in with XXXTentacion.\n\n**TL;DR:** As someone from r/hiphopheads said, if this is true, this is Chris Brown x 100.\n\n---\n\nEDIT: u/icantquitreddit0 put together a [list](https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/6yur73/xxxtentacions_reported_victim_details_grim/dmqjcg5/) of things X has done before"}, {"subreddit": "sports", "label": 8, "post": "Philippe Gilbert falls over a wall in Tour de France "}, {"subreddit": "technology", "label": 5, "post": "Facebook Facing Heavy Criticism After Removing Major Atheist Pages "}, {"subreddit": "politics", "label": 7, "post": "Texas newspaper calls for resignation of state\u2019s senator Ted Cruz after Capitol riots "}, {"subreddit": "science", "label": 2, "post": "NASA's Perseverance rover has landed on Mars NASA [successfully landed](https://blogs.nasa.gov/mars2020/2021/02/18/blog-nasas-perseverance-has-landed/) its *Perseverance* rover and on the surface of Mars in the Jezero Crater at 18 February 2021 at 20:56 UTC.

It's a collection of short but complete games, animations, simulations, and other programming projects. They're more than code snippets, but also simple enough for beginners/intermediates to read the source code of to figure out how they work. The book is released under a Creative Commons license, so it's free to read online. (I'll be uploading it this week when I get the time.) The projects come from this [git repo](https://github.com/asweigart/pythonstdiogames).\n\n**Frequently Asked Questions:** (*read this before posting questions*)\n\n* This course is for beginners and assumes no previous programming experience, but the second half is useful for experienced programmers who want to learn about various third-party Python modules.\n* If you don't have time to take the course now, that's fine. Signing up gives you lifetime access so you can work on it at your own pace.\n* This Udemy course covers roughly the same content as the 1st edition book (the book has a little bit more, but all the basics are covered in the online course), which you can read for free online at https://inventwithpython.com\n* The 2nd edition of Automate the Boring Stuff with Python is free online: https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/\n* I do plan on updating the Udemy course for the second edition, but it'll take a while because I have other book projects I'm working on. If you sign up for this Udemy course, you'll get the updated content automatically once I finish it. It won't be a separate course.\n* It's totally fine to start on the first edition and then read the second edition later. I'll be writing a blog post to guide first edition readers to the parts of the second edition they should read.\n* I wrote a blog post to cover [what's new in the second edition](https://inventwithpython.com/blog/2019/10/07/whats-new-in-the-2nd-edition-of-automate-the-boring-stuff-with-python/)\n* **You're not too old to learn to code. You don't need to be \"good at math\" to be good at coding.**\n* Signing up is the first step.

I tinkered a lot with tKinter (pun almost unintended) and even tried PyQT5. Both of these are time consuming to work with and tKinter's GUI looks like it shouldve been abandoned in 2005. Thats when my quest of finding an easy and modern looking UI Library started. And then I found Python Eel. Eel isnt a GUI Library like tKinter, but it can help link up python as backend with HTML/ CSS as the front. I didn't really know HTML and CSS a lot, but it was fairly easy. My project is at [https://github.com/JeswinSunsi/PentyDesktopAssistant](https://github.com/JeswinSunsi/PentyDesktopAssistant) . It has a bit of Spaghetti code, but its pretty neat. I would appreciate it if you guys could check it out and give a review. Also, star it if you can ;)\n\nThankss.  \n\n\nEdit: After a lot of people told me, I gave another look into PyQt. Although I would still have designed Penty with Eel, PyQt actually doesn't seem too hard, that is, after the sorta steep learning curve. But once you've mastered the basics, it'd be way more readable and easier.\n\nEdit 2: I never expected this post to get these many upvotes and positive comments.

I have  created a small Python course all inside Jupyter Notebook. All you need  to do is to import the notebook files and you can learn the topics and  run the codes - all inside the notebook file itself. I believe that  these notebooks will be more than enough for you to get started in  Python and you might not need to do any other basic Python course  online.\n\nJupyter Notebook files are available [here](https://github.com/ItsAwSM/Python-for-Data-Analytics).\n\nI also have created videos on the notebooks if you need any added explanation.

Representing over two years of work from the Pallets team and contributors, new major versions Flask, Werkzeug, Jinja, Click, ItsDangerous, and MarkupSafe have been released on May 11, 2021. Check out our announcement on our blog: [https://palletsprojects.com/blog/flask-2-0-released/](https://palletsprojects.com/blog/flask-2-0-released/), and retweet it to spread the word on Twitter as well: [https://twitter.com/PalletsTeam/status/1392266507296514048](https://twitter.com/PalletsTeam/status/1392266507296514048)\n\nEvery project has significant changes, and while we don't anticipate breaking things, it may take some time for extensions and other projects to catch up. Be sure to use tools like pip-compile and Dependabot to pin your dependencies and control when you upgrade.\n\nOverall changes to every project include:\n\n* Drop Python 2 and Python 3.5 support. Python 3.6 and above is required, the latest version is recommended. Removing the compatibility code also gives a nice speedup.\n* Add comprehensive type annotations to all the libraries.\n* Better new contributor experience with updated contributing guide and consistent code style with tools like pre-commit and black.\n\nCheck out the changelog links for each project to see all of the great new features and changes. I've included some of the highlights here as well.\n\n* [Flask 2.0](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/changes/#version-2-0-0)\n   * `async def` views and callbacks.\n   * Nested blueprints.\n   * Shortcut HTTP method route decorators like `@app.post()` and `@app.delete()`.\n   * Static files like CSS will show changes immediately instead of needing to clear the cache.\n* [Werkzeug 2.0](https://werkzeug.palletsprojects.com/changes/#version-2-0-0)\n   * `multipart/form-data` is parsed *15x* faster, especially for large file uploads.\n   * Getting ready for async support behind the scenes.\n   * Improved test client experience.\n   * Routing understands websocket URLs.\n* [Jinja 3.0](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/changes/#version-3-0-0)\n   * Async support no longer requires patching.\n   * Lots of weird scoping fixes.\n   * I18N supports `pgettext`.\n* [Click 8.0](https://click.palletsprojects.com/changes/#version-8-0-0)\n   * Completely rewrote the shell tab completion system to be more accurate, customizable, and extensible to new shells.\n   * Support for 256 and RGB color output.\n   * Options can be given as a flag without a value to use a default value or trigger a prompt.\n   * `*` and `~` patterns are expanded on Windows since its terminal doesn't do that automatically.\n   * User-facing messages like validation errors can be translated.\n* [ItsDangerous 2.0](https://itsdangerous.palletsprojects.com/changes/#version-2-0-0)\n* [MarkupSafe 2.0](https://markupsafe.palletsprojects.com/changes/#version-2-0-0)\n\nFour years ago, each project had 150+ open issues, some going back a decade, and pages of open pull requests too. Over time I've grown the maintainer team and the community, and we've managed to cut down the backlog to a much more manageable size. I'm thankful for all contributions and support people have given, and I hope you all continue to build amazing applications with the Pallets projects."}, {"subreddit": "technology", "label": 5, "post": "Just a reminder You already paid for High Speed Fiber Optic Infrastructure in the USA.

When he came into the canteen she was sitting at a table well out from the wall, and was quite alone....\n\n>...He walked casually towards her, his eyes searching for a place at some table beyond her. She was perhaps three meters away from him. Then a voice behind him called, 'Smith!' He pretended not to hear. 'Smith!' repeated the voice, more loudly. It was no use.\nHe turned round. A blond-headed, silly -faced young man named Wilsher, whom he barely knew, was inviting him with a smle to a vacant place at his table. It was not safe to refuse. After having been recognised, he cold not go and sit at a table with an unattended girl. It was too noticeable. He sat down with a friendly smile. The silly blond face beamed into his. Winston had a hallucinations of himself smashing a pickaxe right into the middle of it. The girl's table filled up a few minutes earlier.\n\nWhile Winston struggled to make contact with her because of fear being caught by the Thought Police, I could not help but have flashbacks when I was in Middle and High School, when I couldn't stop thinking about that cute girl and finally gathered enough courage to make the first move, only to have my friends fuck it all up...\n\n\n\n\nEDIT 1: I was going to take the time reading the book, but the great responses in this thread made me to want to finish this book in one go! Currently in the part where O'Brien tells Winston his home address.\n\nEDIT 2: Currently in the part where Winston reads *the book* to Julia. It's chilling that an essay written in 1948 is becoming more and more relevant after each decade.\n\nEDIT 3: There was a telescreen behind the picture!? Oh fuck. Fit is about to hit the Shan, is it?\n\nEDIT 4: The Room 101 scene really reminds me of Burgess' *A Clockwork Orange*\n\nEDIT 5: I finished it. Now I'm gonna go sit in a corner and stare at the wall for some time.\n"}, {"subreddit": "books", "label": 4, "post": "Netflix buys the entire catalog of \u2018Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\u2019 author Roald Dahl "}, {"subreddit": "entertainment", "label": 0, "post": "The Boys Star Antony Starr Rips Into Trump Supporters Dressing as Homelander - Starr says MAGA fans paying tribute to the show's homicidal maniac are engaging in \"the art of ignorant dumbf*ckerry.\" "}, {"subreddit": "music", "label": 6, "post": "T.I. and Wife Tiny Accused of Sexual Assault by Over 30 Women, Lawyer Seeks Investigation | The couple has been accused of 'forced drugging, kidnapping, rape, and intimidation' "}, {"subreddit": "music", "label": 6, "post": "My high school won a contest to have Macklemore and Ryan Lewis preform at my school as well as earn a $10,000 grant for our music programs, however the administration has declined the prize. \nUpdate:Our high school administration revoked their previous decision to decline the prize.

'Bull's on Parade' is a song about how family-value elected politicians would much rather line their own pockets and build their own power than actually support working families. Never has this been more evident then in the last 2 months.\n\nAustralia spent $14.7 billion dollars in the wars in the Middle East, $31 billion dollars in tax breaks to people earning over 180k a year in the income tax cuts of last year, $4.4 billion dollars in subsidies given to Adani, $10 billion dollars a year in subsidies to fossil fuel companies, etc.\n\nThese don't even take into account state government wastage and all the myriads of faux 'support' our government offers corporations, thrusting trickle down economics as the reason for throwing our money away.\n\nOver a billion animals have died, 33 lives have now been lost, more than 2000 homes destroyed, and our 'Family Man' Prime Minister has been bothered, after mass upheaval, to offer $2b in relief with only $367 million being allocated to people effected. MOST OF WHICH HAS BEEN GIVEN TO BUSINESSES, NOT INDIVIDUALS.\n\n\"Weapons, not food, not homes, not shoes, no needs, just feed the war cannibal animal\"\n\n\"They rally around the family, with a pocket full of shells\"\n\nBull's on Parade is our protest. We are tired of governments winning our votes by praising us, only to fuck us the second they get an opportunity. Although our situation is not about wars, our emotions strike the same tone. We should be running a Manhattan Project on our bushfire crisis instead of the measly shit we get offered. We deserve better than this.\n\nSo when you hear that guitar smashing somewhere in the top 10 tomorrow, just know that millions of Australians will be listening in inspiration and anger. It is no mistake that this song is popular again, and we shall carry this anger all the way to the next election. Scott Morrison is NOT the problem, the corruption is systemic, the LNP is a cancer.\n\nRage Against the Machine once said that 'Anger is a gift', tomorrow will be evidence of such.\n\nEnjoy the Hottest 100 tomorrow and I hope you think of this as you hear the anthem we need."}, {"subreddit": "sports", "label": 8, "post": "The Vikings score on a last second touchdown to advance to the NFC Championship "}, {"subreddit": "books", "label": 4, "post": "Michelle Obama\u2019s Becoming is B&N Fastest Selling Book of the Year "}, {"subreddit": "sports", "label": 8, "post": "Embiid celebrates with Kevin Hart.

Are you one? Did you become one? It's always rather mind-boggling to me whenever someone tries to sell me on why they love reading so much on this idea. I've never felt like there was some movie playing internally while I had all the description of novels to take in, there's no sound, no vision.\n\nUsually when I'm reading books it feels more like a stand-in for a storyteller (that's what it is, ultimately), with my reactions mirroring how I would respond to an actual person telling me about what's happened. Taking \"show don't tell\" and telling it right back. All like:\n\n>Book: \"Still, it was difficult to recognize her original features beneath the reddish scabs and sparse hair. The skeleton of her body made a distinct impression through the thin blue hospital sheet. Even in her condition, she could not keep from flirting.\"\n\n>Me: *\"Woah, what happened? She got diseased? This terminal?\"*\n\n>Book: \"Only her voice had not changed. It was difficult to know if she was teasing or not. *\"And I thought you were coming back to me. You will marry her, won't you? Of course, I will try to forgive you because I know you loved me first.\"*\n\n>Me: *\"That's a real possessive attitude right there. Not that I can blame her, you told me she doesn't have anyone else in her life, and now what? You telling me she's practically on her deathbed after a life about having things done to her rather than one about what she could do? Goddamned reality checks.\"*\n\nAudiovisual mediums in contrast feel like they give me some kind of first hand experience of being a witness of the events, which tends to be supported further by how they tend to lack things like a convenient narration to inform me what's going on. I thought that was kind of like, the point. What is the point of having invented movies if we've got 'em playing right in our brains seeing text?

I've been impressed with the singers vocals before, I've enjoyed guitar solos or rap verses.\n\nBut there's never been a song that moved me emotionally.\n\nMy wife left me last october. We've been together for 7 years, and out of the blue she told me she didn't love me anymore and that she wanted a divorce.

Honestly I really don't like referring to borderline with that particular moniker, because I find it reactionary and overt and misleading. I prefer Emotional Regulation Stndrome because it's nicer and more accurate. I find my condition to be more akin to autism than something like anti social personality disorder or sociopathy/psychopathy, all the things media sources tend to group us capricious messes up with.\n\nERS people can and often are insufferable  under the right (wrong) conditions, which seem to be rampant in the context of our current social conventions.\n\n It is wrong to institutionalize us, as you watch us lose all sense and reason, using our reaction to your reaction as the means to dignify grouping us up with damaged strangers in sanitary squalor. You crumble our precarious psyches, which then become pernicious, and then the marginalization of our lives becomes the natural needed course of action for everyone in our lives, our vicinity, our perceived reality.\n\n It is sad and it needs to stop. Determinism is at play and the means and the end in terms of how you treat us is fucked, we do not want to become this. 200,000 men with BPD/ERS statistically will commit suicide and it breaks my heart because I know what feelings they will use as fuel.\n\nFinal update: this post will be referenced as I shop my manuscript around to publishers. Almost a quarter of a million views....still unbelievable. I'm about 70% done with the edits I was given and then....man, who knows.\n\nThanks for everything Reddit.

The purpose of the prize is to draw attention to poorly written, perfunctory or redundant passages of sexual description in modern fiction, and to discourage them. \n\nQuite simply, the award offers a good helping of light, literary-based entertainment. Winners include award-winning writers like Sebastian Faulks and Tom Wolfe. Perhaps the most famous winner was Morrissey in 2015, for the extract of his book \u2018List of the lost\u2019, which features barrel-rolling breasts and \u201cotherwise central zones\u201d. \n\n(Full Morrissey quote/extract here: \u201cAt this, Eliza and Ezra rolled together into the one giggling snowball of full-figured copulation, screaming and shouting as they playfully bit and pulled at each other in a dangerous and clamorous rollercoaster coil of sexually violent rotation with Eliza\u2019s breasts barrel-rolled across Ezra\u2019s howling mouth and the pained frenzy of his bulbous salutation extenuating his excitement as it whacked and smacked its way into every muscle of Eliza\u2019s body except for the otherwise central zone.\u201d)\n\nNow, one thing that is curiously lacking on the internet is one full \u2018compendium\u2019 where you have all the winning extracts in one place. Perhaps an oversight on the part of the Literary Review, or simply because no one has yet got round to cataloguing all the extracts stretching back well over 20 years. \n\nEnter, moi. \n\nNow, I love a good bit of bad sex as much as anyone. And so one Sunday afternoon I decided, since nobody had done it before, it would be a good use of my time to sift through decades of literary archives in search of extraordinarily badly written sex scenes. \n\nThe thing is. I didn\u2019t actually expect it to take as long as it did. \n\nAt first, it was relatively easy. Over the last few years (from about 2013), sites like The Guardian have been publishing the extracts religiously around the time of the awards (November each year). So it was just a case of googling, and copying and pasting. \n\nBetween the early 2000s and 2012, however, things got progressively more difficult as I worked backwards through time. Stories about the awards still existed, but instead of publishing entire extracts, news sites tended instead to just run a news story along the lines of \u2018X famous novelist has won the bad sex in fiction award\u2019, and then choose one or two stand out quotes from the novel in question and perhaps add in a quote from the judges at the literary review. \n\nThis wasn\u2019t a major stumbling block, because, thanks to the internet, it was generally possible to use the \u2018search\u2019 function on a PDF of an online copy of the book (I had to pay to download the e-book version of one or two novels), and then simply copy the key phrase from the quote of the online news article, and that would bring me to the page of the extract in question. Still, it added a considerable amount of admin, research and reading time to the process \u2013 and at this point my Sunday afternoon had become Monday lunchtime and my boss was asking why I hadn\u2019t written that morning\u2019s marketing blog (I was, at the time, working as a marketing content writer). \n\nStill, I wasn\u2019t prepared for the amount of work that was still to come. \n\nSee, the problem with awards that predate the internet is that the years in the mid to late nineties in which the award was running simply weren\u2019t picked up by any online news outlets. All I had to go on was a list on Wikipedia of the winning authors and the names of the books that won the award. \n\nThis meant the only route available to me was to rent or purchase copies of the outstanding novels. Que a trip to my local library (the wonders of your local library!) and an online book spending spree, (Amazon Prime 15-day free trial, anyone?). This was followed by an intense round of speed reading, running my eyes frantically over each page of text looking for the telltale signs of bad sex: \u201cbulging trousers\u201d, \u201cmoans\u201d, \u201cthrobbing penises\u201d and \u201clove truncheons\u201d. \n\nThe intense nature of this reading spell had some ill-wanted effects, including the Wednesday evening train journey during which I exclaimed \u201cyes! condom!\u201d with relief as I found the winning passage in Nicholas Royle\u2019s The Matter of the Heart.  \n\nBy the end of the week I had (skim)-read six full-length novels and found the \u2018winning\u2019 sex scenes of all the books to have won the award at that time (22 in total). I wrote the article, published it, and haven't looked back. \n\nThis might in part be because, on a personal contextual note, this week came during a rather torturous month in which I was breaking up with my SO of three years (whom I also lived with), after discovering she cheated on me. The mind does strange things when heartbroken. \n\nWhatever the reason, it remains the best time I've ever spent reading about bad sex. \n\nYou can check out the article here - https://nothingintherulebook.com/2016/03/19/bad-sex-in-fiction-awards-the-connoisseurs-compendium/ \n\nAnd I also wrote a follow up article about how authors reacted to winning the world famous booby prize - https://nothingintherulebook.com/2016/12/18/a-repulsive-horror-how-famous-writers-responded-to-winning-the-notorious-bad-sex-in-fiction-award/ \n\nThanks comrades - I hope you enjoy reading the extracts as much as I did! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"subreddit": "books", "label": 4, "post": "Cleveland mom vows to spend summer giving away free books: 'I'm scared there is going to be something called the summer corona slide' "}, {"subreddit": "science", "label": 2, "post": "Study Confirms Climate Models are Getting Future Warming Projections Right "}, {"subreddit": "sports", "label": 8, "post": "Kevin Durant gives his shoes to a young fan "}, {"subreddit": "science", "label": 2, "post": "Men tend to use more abstract language than women, suggests new research that analyzed 600,000 blog posts and speeches by more than 1,000 Congress members.

I publicly published all my earnings reports from all the music distribution platforms so people can decide for themselves what services are fair, and which ones are not. I would like to show the actually breakdown of where the money goes across a variety of different music distribution platforms, so you can decide for yourself what is fair, and what is not. I decided to publicly publish all my financial information for the past year. I am an independent musician, that creates instrumental guitar music. I am not bringing home the big bucks, but I feel I have enough information to give an accurate financial depiction. I have all the charts and screenshots published in an imgur link at the bottom of this post. If you check them out and believe that I am missing some valuable insight, please let me know and I can edit that information into this post. Let us begin.\n\n\nI get my stats from the service DistroKid. Please do not think this is just an ad for distrokid, it s not. In fact, the reporting analytics are piss poor, which only allows me to give insight towards Itunes and Spotify. I can see the earnings from all the other services, but don\u2019t have any stats streams/downloads etc.\n\n\n**Itunes**. For every sale on Itunes I keep 77% of the sale. So $0.77 cents per song. I feel that is pretty fair for a behemoth such as Apple. Not much more to it than that, pretty straight forward. \n\n\n**Bandcamp** is a bit more complex. They say they take 15% as their cut from each sale, but after all the paypal fees, it comes out to be much less. When somebody buys my album of of bandcamp for $5.00, I get $3.90 in my paypal account. That is 78%, about the same as Itunes. Important to note however, the more somebody pays for an album the more this percentage goes up. If somebody pays $10 for an album, I get 8.06, so about 80%, but more or less the same. \n\n\nI offer my music for free on bandcamp, with the option to pay. This is just a personal preference, and I believe it fosters a better community of sharing and creation. My revenue from bandcamp (from my 2 album sales, not including individual song sales) has been $1,025. From that, 619 people downloaded them for free, and 160 decided to pay. If you break it down by revenue from total downloads, it comes out to be $1.31 per album. Of those who decided to pay, the average price that was chosen was $6.40. For the time being, I will continue to offer my music for free on bandcamp. I believe if people want it they will download it anyway, and I rather be in control of the channels that they are getting it from. \n\n\nNow for the Streaming.\n\n\n**Spotify**. All in all I have had 176,548 streams on Spotify, which has yielded $706.02. This comes out to be $.004 a stream. This means for every million streams the artist gets paid $4,000. \n\n\n**Youtube**. I believe this is the biggest competitor to spotify. From 356,064 streams on Youtube, I have yielded $145.55. This is with every fucking ad option selected. That comes out to be $.0004 per stream. This comes out to be $400 per million streams. Also, keep in mind that a lot of the music on youtube is not on the artist's channels, in which case they are getting nothing. \n\n\nUnfortunately Distrokid analytics are not that great, so I can not provide any insight on the following services, but I can show you how much I made from each. I would be really interested to see the stream sats for Tidal and Google Play and Apple Music, to see how they relate to spotify. I will update everybody as soon as distrokid gets their shit together and I can report it.\n\n\n* Itunes: $198.80\n* Itunes Match: $0.29\n* Apple Music: $36.44\n* Spotify: $706.02\n* Pandora: $0.33\n* Deezer: $0.86\n* Tidal: $5.49\n* YT music: $1.00\n* Groove Streaming: $0.09\n* Groove Downloads: $0.70\n* Google Play: $8.04\n* Google Play all Access: $14.03\n* Amazon: $28.26\n\n\nI'll leave with this information and decide for yourself the best way to support artists. When I get updated statistics I will post them. Again, don\u2019t think this is an ad for Distrokid. If anything this is a thinly veiled attempt to draw attention to my music by offering you something of value in return. \n\nI will also give you my opinion on the state of music. The music industry is far from dead, it just needs to adapt. I get so annoyed by musicians bitching about how they don\u2019t get paid enough when comparing it to ten years ago. I heard someone say \u201cI am getting paid fractions of a cent fort someone to hear my song, when they used to buy it for a dollar.\u201d That logic just doesn't make sense. I feel like I don\u2019t have to explain to benefit of rapid discovery that has come with the streaming industry. \n\n\nAlso, buying physical copies of music is not dead in any sense. If anything the desire to own an artist's works has grown significantly, and we can see that in the rise in vinyl sales (I learned this in a reddit post the other day). I have sent fans prints of my album art (fans that have found me on spotify), and physical copies of my works as well. Vinyl is coming back in a good way. You know what they say, technology is cyclical. \n\n\nThanks for checking this out. I hope you learned something from this, or at least it gave you a little bit of insight to something you already know a lot about. if you are curious in the music I make, my name is Samuel Orson and you can check out [my shit here](https://samuelorson.bandcamp.com)\n\n\n**Screenshots of Stats and Reporting:** http://imgur.com/a/9ZaT2\n\n"}, {"subreddit": "entertainment", "label": 0, "post": "Thandiwe Newton recalls sexual abuse by film director at 16 "}, {"subreddit": "politics", "label": 7, "post": "Satanic Temple challenges 18 states' abortion laws with religious exemption claim "}, {"subreddit": "science", "label": 2, "post": "The first study of its kind has found that people who vape have the same mix of gut bacteria as non-smokers, whilst smokers have significant changes to their microbiome. "}, {"subreddit": "books", "label": 4, "post": "In Defense of Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy This started off as a reply to someone who said he had read Hitchhikers Guide and didn\u2019t really get it. I looked at the comments and there was a mixture of agreement and defense of the books.  But as I read further, although there were a decent number of comments, I realized that nobody who had replied really saw the books the way I do. \n\nNow, I don\u2019t claim to be a superior intellect or any kind of literary critic of note, but in seeing those comments, i realized that a lot of people, even those who enjoy it, seem to have missed the point entirely (or at least the point that I took away from it). So, here is my response reproduced in its entirety in the hopes that it will inspire people to read, or reread, these masterpieces. \n\nSo I\u2019m responding to this maybe a month late but I guess I have three basic thoughts about how I\u2019ve always seen Hitchhikers that I feel like most respondents didn\u2019t capture. \n\nThe first, and most simplistic view of it is that there\u2019s just general silliness around. The people get into silly situations, react stupidly, and just experience random funny stuff. \n\nThe second, still fairly easy to see bit is Adams just generally making fun of the sci-fi genre. He loves to poke fun at their tropes and describe them ridiculously. \n\nThe final bit though is why I think this series is a true masterpiece. In a way, even though Earth gets demolished in the first few pages of the first book, the characters never really leave. All the aliens they encounter behave fundamentally like humans, with all of our foibles and oddities. \n\nThe first time he does it, he really hammers you over the head with it to try to clue you on what he\u2019s on about. A rude, officious, uncaring local government knocks down Arthur\u2019s house - where he lives - in the name of efficiency. The government doesn\u2019t care about the effect on Arthur\u2019s life. What happens next? A bureaucratic alien race demolishes our entire planet, with all of its history, art, and uniqueness, to make way for a hyperspace bypass that literally doesn\u2019t make any sense and isn\u2019t needed anyway. \n\nIn a lot of ways Arthur\u2019s journey reminds me of The Little Prince, a fantastic book in which a childlike alien boy travels from meteor to meteor and meets various adults like a king, a drunkard, or a businessman. They all try to explain themselves to the little prince who asks questions with childlike na\u00efvet\u00e9 that stump the adults. \n\nAdams is doing the same thing. The Vogons he used as a double whammy to attack both British government officials and awful, pretentious, artsy types. What\u2019s worse than awful poetry at an open mic night and government officials? How about a government official that can literally force you to sit there and be tortured to death by it!\n\nMy absolute favorite bit in the entire series is in the second book which you haven\u2019t read (yet, hopefully).  In the original version of the book he uses the word \u201cfuck\u201d. It was published in the UK as is, but the American publisher balked at printing that book with that word in it. \n\nAdams\u2019s response? He wrote this entire additional scene in the book about how no matter how hardened and nasty any alien in the Galaxy was, nobody, and I mean nobody, would ever utter the word \u201cBelgium.\u201d Arthur is totally perplexed by this and keeps saying it trying to understand, continually upsetting everyone around him. The concept is introduced because someone won an award for using the word \u201cBelgium\u201d in a screenplay. The entire thing is a beautifully written takedown of American puritanical hypocrisy and the publishing industry\u2019s relationship with artists. \n\nAdams uses Arthur\u2019s adventures to muse on the strange existential nature of human existence. He skewers religion, atheists, government, morality, science, sexuality, sports, finance, progress, and mortality just off the top of my head. \n\nHe is a true existential absurdist in the vein of Monty Python. The scenarios he concocts are so ridiculous, so bizarre, that you can\u2019t help but laugh at everyone involved, even when he\u2019s pointing his finger directly at you. \n\nWhether it\u2019s a pair of planets that destroyed themselves in an ever escalating athletic shoe production race, their journey to see God\u2019s final message to mankind, or the accidental discovery about the true origins of the human race, there is a message within a message in everything he writes. \n\nI encourage you to keep going and actually take the time to read between the lines. You won\u2019t regret it. \n\nEDIT: This is the first post I've written on Reddit that blew up to this extent. I've been trying to reply to people as the posts replies roll in, but I'm literally hundreds behind and will try to catch up. I've learned a lot tonight, from both people who seemed to enjoy my post, people who felt that it was the most obvious thing in the world to write, and people who seem to bring to life one of the very first lines of the book, \"This planet has\u2014or rather had\u2014a problem, which was this: most of the people living on it were unhappy for pretty much all of the time.\"\n\nIn retrospect maybe I shouldn't have posted this on a Thursday.\n\nI've also learned that I should spend more time in a subreddit before posting on it; apparently this book is quite popular here and a lot of people felt that I could have gone more out on a limb by suggesting that people on the internet like cats on occasion. This has led me to understand at least part of the reason why on subreddits I'm very active on I see the same shit recycle a lot... I'm gonna have a lot more sympathy for OPs who post popular opinions in the future.\n\nAt the request of multiple people, here was the thread I originally read that led me to write this response. https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/87j5pu/just_read_the_hitchhikers_guide_to_the_galaxy_and/\n\nFinally, thank you for the gold kind stranger.

I'm 49 years old and, before I had kids, used to love to go to rock concerts.  The first concert I ever went to was Eric Clapton's Crossroads Tour, which was back in 1988.  I think I paid something like $20 for the ticket, and got decent seats, which, adjusted for inflation, is about $41 now.  Tickets were the same price throughout the whole stadium.  It all depended on how soon you got tickets.  So, some fan dedication was required to get good seats.\n\nYesterday, I got an email offering me pre-sales of Paul Simon tickets.  Being in my late 40s, and never having seen Paul Simon before, I figured it would be worth checking him out.\n\nI click on the link and my choices are $47.50 for nose bleed crappy seats all the way through $175.00 for the VIP package, which includes seats up close.\n\nI find those prices to be completely insane!\n\nI used to be a big believer in supporting artists by going to see them live, and I always dreamed of being able to take my kids to concerts with me so we could all enjoy the live performance together.  But I just can't afford it any more.\n\nTook my kids to see Imagine Dragons in concert 3 years ago, and we paid close to $200 for tickets and we were very high up.\n\nBetween the tickets and the service fees things have gotten out of hand.\n\nMakes me sad.  I've seen Claptop, The Moody Blues (x3), Rush (x4), Jethro Tull (x2), The Kinks, Pat Benatar, Styx (x2), Richard Marx (remember him?), Jefferson Airplane, Emerson Lake and Palmer, The Who, Paul McCartney, The Beach Boys, Wilson-Phillips, Chicago, Cheap Trick, Weird Al (probably the best concert I have ever seen), The Hooters, Hall and Oates, Warren Zevon (probably the most boring concert I have ever been to), Yes, and a bunch of other artists who I am probably forgetting."}, {"subreddit": "politics", "label": 7, "post": "Trump's inner circle is telling him that Giuliani and the rest of his legal team are making him look like an idiot, report says "}, {"subreddit": "technology", "label": 5, "post": "Zoom banned from New York City schools due to privacy, security flaws.

In python, the \"in\" keyword has a time complexity of O(n). This slowed down my program by a LOT, as there were MANY books. So each test run used to take me around 2-3 minutes on my potato laptop. So I was losing a lot of time testing my code.\n\nThen I discovered these things called sets in python. The time complexity of \"in\" for sets is O(1) or constant time. After I changed the list to a set and replaced all the \"append\" with \"add\" and ran the program, it finished executing in less than 2 seconds. \n\nSo always, ALWAYS, look for a better tool for your job. I was a huge beginner to data structure and algo based questions, and after solving the problem, I got a score of about 26 million, which placed me at the 881st place globally (This was after the qualification round was over, after which everyone had an opportunity to try the challenge for a week iirc). \n\nI just thought this was a fun story to share :)\n\nTL;DR: I switched my main program logic from using lists to using sets, and made my program run in less than 2 seconds from taking 2-3 minutes to run."}, {"subreddit": "python", "label": 1, "post": "I just got a 67k job before I even graduated, all thanks to python.

I know a lot of people hate the country music genre in general, but modern country is an absolute shell of what country music started as and is supposed to be. You used to be able to have a country song without it including mud, a truck, beer, the mention of cowboy boots or a cornfield. It's supposed to be much more than that and I think if we still had country from the good 'ol days, a lot less people would hate it. Country music is supposed to draw from down to earth living, love of the simple things, living a rural or blue collar life, overcoming struggle, working hard, love, etc just like a lot of other genres. Nowadays you're hard pressed to find a country song that's not part an extremely specific stereotype that's been pumped out for the past decade.\n\nI understand some people are just never going to enjoy or relate to country music and that's fine but Jesus Christ let's stop acting like 85% of these modern artists are country. \"Hick\" would be a more appropriate name for this genre. It's the Party Down South types who think wearing a camouflage tank top and enjoying fishing is an identity. Singing about drinking, driving a truck in the mud, having a dog and a pretty blonde girlfriend to the twang of an acoustic guitar don't equate to a country lifestyle or music. These people took the soul out of country and killed the genre. \n\nLoretta Lynn. Dolly Parton. Johnny Cash. The Carter Family. Hank Williams. Merle Haggard. George Jones. Glen Campbell. Waylon Jennings. Patsy Cline. THEY are country, when it was still a respectable and relatable genre. The majority of what's released today under the 'country' label is a slap in the face to all of them. Modern \"country singers\" turned the genre into a joke.\n\nNow, I'm not saying there are zero good country artists today. I have a few faves. But most of them just have seemed to complete miss the point of country music.\n\nEdit: OK not trying to get myself to the victory speeches sub but goodness gracious was I not expecting this kind of response...I'm in a tizzy now cuz there's no way I can read all the comments"}, {"subreddit": "science", "label": 2, "post": "An international team of researchers has discovered a new material which, when rolled into a nanotube, generates an electric current if exposed to light.

This morning PornHub (with 75 million daily visitors) [announced](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/pornhub-will-show-its-75-million-daily-visitors-why-net-neutrality-matters) that they will be participating. Since we announced earlier this month a ton of other high-traffic sites have signed on including Imgur, Amazon, Namecheap, OK Cupid, Bittorrent, Mozilla, Kickstarter, Etsy, GitHub, Vimeo, Chess.com, Fark, Checkout.com, Y Combinator, and Private Internet Access. \n\nReddit itself has also joined, [along with](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6g9pkl/reddit_lets_get_organized_more_than_30_subreddits/) more than 30 subreddits!\n\nNet neutrality is the basic principle that prevents Internet Service Providers like Comcast and Verizon from charging us extra fees to access the content we want -- or throttling, blocking, and censoring websites and apps. Title II is the legal framework for net neutrality, and the FCC is trying to get rid of it, under immense pressure for the Cable lobby.\n\nThis day of action is an incredibly important moment for the Internet to come together -- across political lines -- and show that we don't want our Cable companies controlling what we can do online, or picking winners and losers when it comes to streaming services, games, and online content.\n\nThe current FCC chairman, Ajit Pai, is a former Verizon lawyer and seems intent on getting rid of net neutrality and misleading the public about it. But the FCC has to answer to Congress. If we can create another moment of massive online protest like the SOPA Blackout and the Internet Slowdown, we have a real chance of stopping the FCC in its tracks, and protecting the Internet as a free and open platform for creativity, innovation, and exchange of ideas. \n\nSo! If you've got a website, blog, Tumblr, or any kind of social media following, or if you are a subreddit mod or active in an online community or forum, please get involved! There's so much we as redditors can do, from blacking out our sites to drive emails and phone calls to organizing in-person meetings with our lawmakers. Feel free to message me directly or email team (at) fightforthefuture (dot) org to get involved, and **[learn more here.](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12)**\n\n**EDIT:** Oh hai, everyone! Very glad you're here. Lots of awesome brainstorming happening in the comments. Keep it coming. A lot of people are asking what sites will be doing on July 12. We're still encouraging brainstorming and creativity, but the basic idea is that sites will have a few options of things they can do to their homepage to show what the web would be like without net neutrality, ie a slow loading icon to show they are stuck in the slow lane, a \"site blocked\" message to show they could be censored, or an \"upgrade your Internet service to access this site\" fake paywall to show how we could be charged special fees to access content. Love all your ideas! Keep sharing, and **[go here for more info about the protest.](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12)**\n\n**EDIT 2:** It's worth noting that given the current chairman of the FCC's political orientation, it's extra important that conservatives, libertarians, and others to the right of center speak out on this issue. The cable lobby is working super hard to turn this technological issue into a partisan circus. We can't let them. Net neutrality protects free speech, free markets, innovation, and economic opportunity. We need people and sites from all across the political spectrum to be part of this.

I'm posting it on r/Python, and hope you find it helpful. Hello all\n\nI asked you people if you are interested in learning Python by writing a Reddit bot some time back on r/learnprogramming. I received immense number of responses, so I'm posting it on r/python. It covers the process, practices and tools involved in writing a Reddit bot in Python.\n\nPlease post your feedback and questions in comments, and I'll be happy to answer them.\n\n#**Requirements**:\n\n1. You are somewhat familiar with programming in general, and have an idea about Python or other languages (like what are variables etc)\n2. You  are on a Unix-like system with access to command line tools\n3. Familiarity with [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Github](https://github.com/) (Not really required...it is better if you are familiar)\n4. A Reddit account\n\nEven if you don't meet these requirements...no need to worry!\n\n#**Introduction**\n\nWriting a bot for Reddit is easier than you think, because Reddit provides a structured method to access its data via the [Reddit API](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api). There are amazing tools like [PRAW](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) which can help simplify the process. PRAW is a Python wrapper for Reddit, and it takes the pain out of the process of writing a bot.\n\n\nAnd as I said earlier, Python is an great language, which is easy to grasp for beginners. What even more amazing is it's community, which has made incredible open-source tools and libraries for almost anything. We will be using some of those, and you will realise how useful they are!\n\n#**Important information - Please read**\n\n1. While this post will cover a variety of programming topics, I highly encourage you to explore more. Go ahead and read the documentation of libraries used and think about how can you improve something in your project. I will possibly add more topics to this post.\n\n2. Please **DO NOT CREATE SPAM** by letting your bot run on all of Reddit before you have thoroughly tested it. **r/test** exists for you to do all sorts of testing with your bot...please use it. Refer to [botiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/bottiquette) and keeping in mind the type of bot you create, comply with the guidelines.\n\n#**The code and resources**\n\nI jus wrote a bot for Reddit, which posts a textual explanation of the popular webcomic [xkcd](https://www.xkcd.com) whenever it encounters an xkcd link. It is named **explainxkcdbot**. As of now, I have set my bot to run on r/test only to let you people test it all you want.\n\n\nYou can find the complete source code on my Github page - \n**https://github.com/aydwi/explainxkcdbot**\n\nHere is the code for the bot -\n**https://github.com/aydwi/explainxkcdbot/blob/master/explainxkcdbot.py**\n\n\n#**How to run the bot**\n\nThe process is given here - https://github.com/aydwi/explainxkcdbot/blob/master/README.md\n\nIf you have any problems in running the bot, please let me know in the comments.\n\n\n#**Let us begin**\n\nWe will move forward step-by-step in the code, and see what is going on.\n\n##Section 1 - Importing libraries\n\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/aydwi/e5e4f294b66adf1cb025a70a0392f847\n\n\nThis is the beginning of the program. Any line which begins with a `#` sign is a comment in Python, so it is not interpreted as code. Then we import the essential libraries required for out program. These libraries contain the methods (or functions) which we will use throughout our program. The syntax is pretty straightforward. Next we see 3 variables with some values assigned to them. More on them later.\n\n\n##Section 2 - Authenticating\n\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/aydwi/b941d04d8128e415d6630e961cc97988\n\n\nThis is where important things begin. Before proceeding, you should have a basic idea of what are **[classes](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html)** and **[methods](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3786881/what-is-a-method-in-python)** in Python. One more important thing is an **object** - it is an instance of class, which holds the data variables declared in class and the **member functions work on these objects**. Please make a comment if you do not understand, I will try to explain.\n\n\n`def authenticate():` defines a function which will try to authenticate the bot to Reddit. This is where PRAW comes into play as it provides us methods to do this. Remember we created a *praw.ini* file earlier. It is a configuration file that stores authentication credentials, so that you just call it whenever needed.\n\n\nNext, we pass authentication parameters to `praw.Reddit()`. Here `explainbot` refers to the credentials in the configuration file, and `user_agent` is a descriptive string about your script/bot. This returns a [Reddit instance](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code_overview/reddit_instance.html), which we assign to the variable `reddit`, and use this variable whenever we wish to authenticate.\n\n\nNext up, we make a print statement to see who is getting authenticated i.e. the name. The `user` class in PRAW provides methods for the currently authenticated user. We call the method `me()` on `user` and then call it on the variable holding the Reddit instance for authentication, which in our case is `reddit`. So the statement becomes `reddit.user.me()`. We just use some [formatting in python](https://pyformat.info/) to print it.\n\n\nFinally we `return` the variable `reddit`. Now i can use this `authenticate()` function in my program by calling it when I need it, and it will give me the variable `reddit`, which stores the Reddit instance.\n\n------------------------------\n\n**Important note 1:** Why did I create a function? It is because creating functions makes us easy to manage out code. We write separate functions for separate features of the program, and call them wherever needed. This breaks the code into manageable chunks, which makes it easy to read, modify and debug.\n\n------------------------------\n\n##Section 3 - Scraping\n\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/aydwi/699123424e7b38da19d62e69339e859c\n\n\nNext up is the function `def fetchdata(url)`. Notice how this function takes a parameter `url`. We pass this parameter whenever we call this function. The purpose of this function is to scrape/gather the data from the web, in order to post an explanation.\n\n\n**Now scraping is not a very reliable process**, but sometimes we just have to do it. We go to a website, go through it's HTML source, and extract the text, links etc. that we want. Here we use **[Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/quickstart/#make-a-request)** library to make a web request, and **[Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)** to extract the data.\n\n\n`r = requests.get(url)` gives a Response object called `r`. We can get all the information we need from this object. Then we call the method `content` on `r`, and pass it to `soup = BeautifulSoup(r.content, 'html.parser')`, which gives us a `soup` object with which we can retrieve elements of a web page. Read more [here](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/).\n\n\nNow what happens depends on what are you scraping. Every website has different type of content, and you should go through the HTML to see how can you retrieve what you want. In my case http://explainxkcd.com has it's explanation inside the first few `<p>` tags, so I look for the first `<p>` tag by `tag = soup.find('p')`. Also, immediately after the explanation ends, `<h2>` tag follows, so I know where to stop. Now take a look here-\n\n    while True:\n        if isinstance(tag, bs4.element.Tag):\n            if tag.name == 'h2':\n                break\n            if tag.name == 'h3':\n                tag = tag.nextSibling\n            else:\n                data = data + '\\n' + tag.text\n                tag = tag.nextSibling\n        else:\n            tag = tag.nextSibling\n\nI continue to look through the tags, and store textual data in a `string` named `data` and move to the next tag. I `break` the process if I encounter `<h2>` because I know that is where explanation ends. The code depends on the structure of website you are scraping. Finally, I return `data`, so that now when I call the function like `fetchdata('http://explainxkcd.com/1024')` for example, it returns me the explanation of comic 1024 as a `string` named `data`.\n\n----------------\n\n**Important note 2:** Scraping is unreliable. If the website changes it's structure, you have to change your code. In this case, it can still include some tags which we don't want. The line `if (tag.name == 'h3')` in the above function is for handling one such unexpected situation I encountered on http://explainxkcd.com. This is why we like to have APIs. \n\n--------------------------\n\n\n##Section 4 - Using regular expressions, parsing URLs, handling exceptions and preventing duplicate submissions\n\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/aydwi/700db3e46770d13fe89356d0fa4f570d\n\n\nThis function which takes a parameter which is a Reddit instance (remember that Reddit instance from Section 1). Again we use PRAW to get one or more subreddits, and go through their comments. See [here](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code_overview/reddit/subreddits.html) and [here](http://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code_overview/models/comment.html).\n\nYou can pass multiple subreddits like `for comment in reddit.subreddit('test+learnprogramming+pics')`.\n\n**Regular Expressions**: Now I want to extract xkcd links from the comments, so I need to look for a pattern for the URL. xkcd links are of the form `https://www.xkcd.com/[some number]`. So we make use of regular expressions from the `re` library to match the pattern. [More about regular expressions](https://regexone.com/references/python).\n\n    match = re.findall(\"https://www.xkcd.com/[0-9]+\", comment.body)\n        if match:\n            print(\"Link found in comment with comment ID: \" + comment.id)\n            xkcd_url = match[0]\n\nHere I look for all strings that are like `https://www.xkcd.com/[some number]` using the method `findall` from [user comments](http://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code_overview/models/comment.html), and if it matches, it returns a list with the matching URL, and we store our URL in the variable `xkcd_url`.\n\n----------------\n\n**Important note 3:** Try to find out regular expressions (regex) to improve this program. What happens if a user posts 'https://xkcd.com/1024' or http version as 'http://www.xkcd.com/1024'. These are still valid xkcd URLs. There can be some other cases where the URL might be placed between a bunch of symbols in a comment. Try to modify the regex statement so that it can detect these cases as well.\n\n--------------------------\n\n\n**URL parsing**: Now I have an xkcd URL. I have 2 immediate objectives now- \n\nObjective 1. To extract the comic number at the end of the URL. We use [urllib.parse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html) for this purpose.\n\n    url_obj = urlparse(xkcd_url)\n            xkcd_id = int((url_obj.path.strip(\"/\")))\n\nObjective 2. Form a complete **explainxkcd.com** URL, which I will pass as a parameter to the function `fetchdata(url)` (See Section 2)\n\n    myurl = 'http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/' + str(xkcd_id)\n\nBoth objectives are thus complete.\n\n**Preventing duplicate submissions and Exception handling**: The bot needs to make sure it replies to every comment only once. There are many methods you can try which include using a separate key-value database like [Memcached](https://memcached.org/), but we will use a simpler approach.\n\n\nJust create a text file (remember commented.txt), store the comment ID of a comment in it when you  visit a relevant comment, and verify if a comment ID already exists in that file before making new comments. Remember to put the location of the text file in the `path` variable (from Section 1), so that you can pass it to the method `open()`.\n\n\nNow, what happens when a user makes a comment like 'https://www.xkcd.com/689243348723'. This xkcd does not exist, but the program will extract '689243348723', then form a link like http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/689243348723, and pass it to the function `fetchdata(url)`. Now **the function will return an exception and your program will stop/crash**. You need to take care of these situations.\n\nThis is achieved using `try`, `except` and `else` blocks. [See here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html) Here is the code for these 2 steps-\n\n    file_obj_r = open(path,'r')\n                        \n            try:\n                explanation = fetchdata(myurl)\n            except:\n                print('Exception!!! Possibly incorrect xkcd URL...\\n')\n                # Typical cause for this will be a URL for an xkcd that does not exist (Example: https://www.xkcd.com/772524318/)\n            else:\n                if comment.id not in file_obj_r.read().splitlines():\n                    print('Link is unique...posting explanation\\n')\n                    comment.reply(header + explanation + footer)\n                    \n                    file_obj_r.close()\n\n                    file_obj_w = open(path,'a+')\n                    file_obj_w.write(comment.id + '\\n')\n                    file_obj_w.close()\n                else:\n                    print('Already visited link...No reply needed\\n')\n\n\nNotice how I make a reply to a relevant comment by using the variables from Section 1 to print header and footer description alongside the explanation - `comment.reply(header + explanation + footer)`\n\n\nNext we make some `sleep` statements to stop the bot from querying Reddit too fast. If the Reddit API returns an error due to too many requests, adjust `val` in the instances of `time.sleep(val)` in your program.\n\n\n##Section 5: The main function\n\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/aydwi/99323ebd710428f4590077a844236f83\n\n\nWe are almost done here. We wrap our functions into a `main` function by calling `authenticate()` (remember Section 1) and passing it to the function which runs the bot, namely `run_explainbot(reddit)`. Since we are calling it inside `while` loop with the expression 'True', it will run indefinitely.\n\n\n#My bot in action\n\n\nTest post to show the bot in action: https://redd.it/6tey71 (Since I'm not running it continuously as of now, it won't reply to every comment containing an xkcd link there)\n\nMy Terminal emulator while running the bot: http://imgur.com/4TzEyor\n\n\n**Finally, if you want to take this project further, you are welcome to contribute code to [my Github repository](https://github.com/aydwi/explainxkcdbot). You can fork it (please note that there are still some checks to be added in order to make the bot more Reddit friendly) or open a pull request.** I'll try to add more details about file handling and scraping aspects of the program once I get some time. \n"}, {"subreddit": "science", "label": 2, "post": "Energy drink consumption linked to depression, anxiety and stress, finds a new longitudinal study that follows 897 individuals from birth to age 22.

Somewhere along the line the internet completely overtook my reading hobby. After a few years of almost no reading at all, I'm finally back in! I'm sure there aren't many who actually care, but I'm feeling good so I thought I'd share! \n\nGrowing up, I was the biggest bibliophile. I'd read whatever, whenever, wherever. My favorite past time was reading, and my second favorite past time was finding new books to read. I'd devour whole books in one sitting, whole series in one week. I had a genuine, unrelenting passion for words and I did whatever I could to consume them. \n\nI don't know what happened, but somewhere along the line my phone/the internet/social media slowly inched its way into the space which once held my desire to read. My attention span got to the point that even when/if I did try to read a book, I couldn't make it past a page without having to put it down and do something else. In the past couple of years I've read only a very small handful of books - some of which took me months or even the entire year. I've had years pass without picking up a single book, despite having hundreds at my disposal. I've realised just how much social media and other electronic activities have invaded and infiltrated my life multiple times throughout the years, but the idea of doing what I once loved became scary and daunting. I'd pick up a book to try and break the cycle, but I'd get hit with the new goldfish-attention-span, or my phone would ding, or I'd sit there and re-read the same page over and over again 17 times before realising I was still on the same page. \n\nI think for a while there I just gave up. I didn't feel the things I used to feel while reading, I couldn't recreate that genuine desire. I resigned to the idea that the thing I used to love most was just a long forgotten chapter in an old part of my life. I stopped trying. \n\nBut a couple of weeks ago, I decided to have a Harry Potter movie marathon for the first time in a while. I got sucked in, moreso than usual - and had an idea. Of all the times I've tried to get back into reading, I had never tried to re-read something that I used to love. I always tried the latest hits, or something I heard about somewhere. I had never thought to revisit an old love, try to rekindle that old flame by well, rekindling an old flame! So I went out, bought the first book in the Harry Potter series (one of my absolute favorites when I was younger) and decided to give it a go. I put my phone away, made myself a cozy reading area, and just decided to try it without forcing myself into the pressure of trying on a new book. \n\nNow I know it's still early on, but I honestly think it's done the trick. I sat down, with the idea that I would give it 15-30 minutes to start, and ended up devouring the whole book in less than a couple of hours. I loved being able to revisit this world that I used to love so much, and I loved being able to discover new things within a story I was already familiar with. It's been less than 48 hours since I started, and I'm already onto the 3rd book. That's almost 3 books in 48 hours -- which is 3 more books than I've read in the past 2(?) years! I know a lot of people have issues with re-reading books/series, I used to be one of them, but I genuinely believe that the magic and wonder of your first read can be visited again - and has the power to change you just as it did the first time around. \n\nEdit: everyone\u2019s complaining about my one-paragraph-mobile-formatting-brick so I fixed it, hope that helps"}, {"subreddit": "politics", "label": 7, "post": "She Noticed $200 Million Missing, Then She Was Fired | Alice Stebbins was hired to fix the finances of California\u2019s powerful utility regulator.

I have just finished a trilogy and went on Goodreads to express my thoughts and appreciation. I did skim through the reviews to see what others thought of the books, as one does when stumbles onto the biggest book review site. What I have found is that people leave one star reviews saying *\"it has sexual slavery in it\" \"it has rape in it\" \"it has lots of mention of gay sex in it\"  \"it contains dubious consent\"* etc etc. so it contains what is otherwise known as **triggers** in it. Now, this series' description is quite clear that it has mature content, it has slavery and that this is an enemies-to-lovers, fantasy with M/M romance in it. So assuming one doesn't blindly grab books from the bookshelf/download random stuff to their e-reader it is safe to say that readers are well aware of the summary before diving in, thus giving themselves and the writer consent to deal with and read about such unpleasant or out-of-the-ordinary themes. \n\nIf you know you are sensitive to slavery then why do you choose a book that has it as a main plot driver then go online and moan about it? Nobody forced you to pick this story, nobody forced you to keep on reading. It's like knowing you don't like milk in your tea, but ordering a milky tea then complain about not liking it. Or if you are not sure whether you like milk in your tea and you want to be adventurous and order one, then realise after a sip that this is not for you, you can just leave it and have one made in a way you know you enjoy. Not forcibly slurp it up then go complain about it. \n\nLeaving negative reviews because, let's say, the writing style is not up to your standards or you find the story boring or the characters one-dimensional, that is fair enough and when you see thousands of people saying the same thing chances are their opinion has merit. \n\nWhat really grinds my gears that when it comes to less-known or rising writers working with indie or small publishing houses these, frankly undeserved reviews can cut deep. It will only encourage writers to put themselves in a carefully constructed box of mainstream, acceptable themes and stories, and that is pretty much the death of artistic freedom for the sake of what? Political correctness? If we know anything about human history is that it is full of suffering, struggling, pain and bravery in the face of adversity; all of these include and caused by things modern societies view as triggers.

This can make investment decisions for the retail investor rather difficult especially if you don't want to follow 'the herd'. **I wanted to change that.**\n\n**Insert the** [**FinanceDatabase**](https://github.com/JerBouma/FinanceDatabase)**.** A database of over 180.000 symbols (80k+ companies, 15k+ ETFs, 30k+ Funds, 3k+ Cryptocurrencies and more) that is fully categorised per country, industry, sector, category and more.

If you read a YA book for teenagers and hate it it's not because the book is bad, it's because it's not meant for you (Eragon, Divergent, Artemis Fowl, etc.) As a book lover I've lurked this sub for awhile now and people really should check what age group the book was written for before reading them or making posts about how bad they are. Eragon, Cirque De Freak, Artimis Fowl, Divergent, Twilight, the list goes on and on. These books are meant for Young Adults and Teenagers. It's not a surprised if you read them at 27 and realize how bad they are.\n\nThey aren't bad books, they're just not books for you. It's okay to admit that and move on.

I'm willing to look at that and say that Avengers isn't inherently bad, but it doesn't suit my preference. Try to look at books the same way. Even though something like Twilight can be torn to shreds for the author's poor writing, it is beloved and treasured by such a large audience it's obvious there was something there that made it great but didn't suit my taste so saying it's a bad book is simply not true. Pointing out flaws and saying something is bad are two different things.\n\n\nEdit 2: The comments are pretty fun you should check them out. Admittedly most of them say I'm wrong and an idiot lol. But the others are filled with people saying a book is horrible and then others saying the same book is great. The only constant is that Divergent and Eragon seem to be hated by almost everyone, it's like a 9/1 ratio. Artemis Fowl is nearly 50/50 which is cool. Take a look and find other people opinions, there are some gems in there.

His world is rife with character and depth and is as lively as our own, as well as adorably tongue-in-cheek at times. Each character I feel like I know on a personal level. I had legitimate difficulty putting this book down and that has not happened in at least ten years. \n\nOne of my favorite things about this series is that there\u2019s a sort of science to the magic the characters create, which called sympathy. This lets you more or less deduce how things take effect and sort of tally what\u2019s happening magically, something I don\u2019t think a lot of fantasy books have, in my experience. Rothfuss meshes magic with actual established science and reason making it just that much more believable.\n\nTruth be told I\u2019m nearly halfway through Wise Man\u2019s Fear, the second book, and it\u2019s just as great for further establishing the world at large.

Do you know Dagny Taggart? She's a character in Atlas Shrugged. She's also a best selling author of language learning ebooks on Amazon. She speaks 15 languages apparently. According to her bio, she spends her life traveling and picking up languages along the way.\n\nThere's just one problem, Dagny Taggart doesn't exist. Her bio is fake, her profile picture is a stock photo. The books she writes are full of errors because they are written by a person (or perhaps a group of people) that doesn't actually speak the language and is just copying and writing in her own words what she learns from free language learning websites. \n\nDespite the glaring errors in her books that are obvious to anyone that can actually speak the language, her books are well reviewed, 4.5 out of 5 stars on almost every single one. There are the top selling books in every language category. How could this be? Dagny Taggart is paying for fake reviews, and it's working.\n\nI am an indie author. In full disclosure, I must inform the reader that Dagny Taggart is my direct competition. I am losing to her, and not just her, most of the best selling language learning ebooks are actually just scams. \n\nIt's a relatively easy scam. Go on the internet, look up some topic, usually one where a lot of general information can be learned online (languages, travel, diets, exercise, cooking) write it up in your own words into an ebook, get a professional cover, pay a company to write fake reviews for you, and BAM, you have a steady income stream. I estimate from my own sales that Dagny Taggart's books have scammed hundreds of thousands of dollars out of people in this year alone. \n\nSo why hasn't Amazon put a stop to this? Why are fake reviews so rampant despite Amazon's best efforts? Amazon has taken a few actions. Recently, they have weighted the reviews of verified purchases, which is a good step, but can easily be overcome in the ebook world. Amazon has also brought lawsuits against the companies that sell fake reviews, another good step, but if there is a market for something, it will always exist.\n\nThere is actually an easy fix to this scam. Something that Amazon has missed completely: **average number of reviews over sales**. My own book was downloaded over 5000 times in a three month period, which netted me 15 reviews. That's about 3 reviews per 1000 downloads. I imagine other products are similar, but the true statistics only Amazon knows. Some of Dagny Taggart's books received ten reviews on the very first day of publication. This past week, another scammer's book has received over 100 reviews (and counting). Could it be that they each had thousands of downloads on the very first day of publication, or during this past week? No, of course not. They paid professional reviews to astroturf.\n\nThe simple solution is to red flag products that receive reviews in excess of the R/S ratio (reviews over sales), investigate the authors that are scamming the system, unpublish their works, refund their customers, and ban them from publishing again. Of course, there is a flaw in this as well, someone might pay a company to write fake reviews for their competition in order to get them banned, but if that competition were to contact Amazon and agree to delete the fake positive reviews, perhaps they could be forgiven. \n\nThe big joke is, many of Amazon's top reviewers are professional astroturfers. The criminals have been given badges. It's easy to spot an astroturfer. Just click on their name. They write about ten book reviews a day. How many of you buy more than one book a day on Amazon, let alone buy and review it? They must be the fastest readers in the world! \n\n**Ultimately, the problem lies in the consumers themselves.** All the information I have told you in this article can easily be found out by anyone who takes the time to check the reviews of a product. In fact, for most of Dagny Taggart's books, the top review is a one star review that tells you all about the scam. A simple glance at the dates the reviews were published will tell you if a product received ten reviews in one hour. Unfortunately, the majority of ebook consumers don't take a few minutes to do their due diligence, they just look for the stars, and so the best selling books remain the ones with the most positive reviews. You may say it's their own fault, buyer beware, but in the end this will hurt all indie publishers when readers realize their purchases were a scam, and lead them to trust Amazon's review system and indie publishers less and less. \n\nWhat can we do to get Amazon to implement the simple fix of red flagging works that receive too many reviews per sales? What other solutions do you think would be a good idea? \n\n**Edit:** Dagny's lawyer has contacted me, thoughts?

My legs were so swollen and the skin on them so tightly stretched that I could scarcely bend my knees. I had to leave my shoes unlaced in order to make them fit my swollen feet. There would not have been space for socks even if I had had any. So my partly bare feet were always wet and my shoes always full of snow. \n\n\u2014 \u201cMan\u2019s Search for Meaning\u201d Pg 27\n\nThe quote above comes from Viktor Frankl as he explains life at a Nazi concentration camp. He suffered from edema, which caused his tissues to swell up and made moving around torture. His feet were uncovered as he walked through snow and didn\u2019t have a pair of socks\u2013not that he could wear them anyway because his shoes were already tight due to his swollen feet. With barely any clothes or gear, he and others were still forced to mine the frozen ground for ten or more hours a day. \n\nThe only nutrition prisoners were given was a bowl of very watery soup once daily and a small piece of bread. Sometimes they were given special extra allowances consisting of a piece of cheese or a slice of poor quality sausage. \n \nLife wasn\u2019t much better for Alistair Urquhart at the Japanese labor camps. He was given only a cup of rice and water for each meal. From constantly working in the jungle with no shoes, he developed tropical ulcers. There was a doctor in his camp but he didn\u2019t have any medicine so the best advice he gave Urquhart was to put maggots on his foot to eat the dead skin. \n\nAs crazy as it sounds, it\u2019s true:\n\n>\u201cI left the medical hut, shaking my head, still wondering if I were being had. Letting maggots eat my skin did not sound particularly appetizing but I was willing to try anything. I knew I had to stop the rot that was devouring my legs.\u201d \n\n\u2014 \u201cThe Forgotten Highlander\u201d Pg 171\n\nAnd the craziest part is it actually worked. However, Urquhart said that even years later he would sometimes get the sensation of maggots eating his skin. An unfortunate side effect, but he did live to be 97 years old. \nAlistair Urquhart, author of \"The Forgotten Highlander.\"\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n4) Survival Requires The Right Mindset \n\n>\u201c\u2018It\u2019s easy for these men to give up and when they lose hope the fight just seeps right out of them. On countless occasions I have seen two men with the same symptoms and same physical state, and one will die and one will make it. I can only put that down to sheer willpower.\u2019 \n\n\u2014 \u201cThe Forgotten Highlander\u201d Pg 170 \n\nUrquhart writes that he could tell which men would die by simply looking at their faces. Those with a lost gaze in their eyes didn't last long. It was in that moment that Urquhart made the decision that he would not stop fighting\u2013even if it required him to put maggots on his feet to survive. \n\nAleksandr Solzhenitsyn learned a similar lesson. \n\n>\u201cAnd the conclusion is: Survive to reach it! Survive! At any price!... This is the great fork of camp life. From this point the roads go to the right and to the left. One of them will rise and the other will descend. If you go to the right\u2013you lose your life, and if you go to the left\u2013you lose your conscience.  \n\n\u2014 \u201cThe Gulag Archipelago\u201d Pg 302\n\nSolzhenitsyn notes that prisoners had to make a decision, do whatever it takes to survive or fall short and die. This didn\u2019t mean kill other people to survive, but rather it was a change in mindset. \n\nIn his book, Solzhenitsyn writes that prisoners were allowed to take baths\u2013with only cold water\u2013but then had to endure a trip back to camp in subzero temperatures. Yet, none of them got pneumonia, in fact, they didn\u2019t even catch a cold. \n\nHowever, when one of those prisoners was finally released and he could live in a warm home and take warm baths, he got ill the first month. The mindset of surviving at any price was not there anymore. Changing one's mindset can have an incredible impact on the rest of the body. \nAleksandr Solzhenitsyn, author of \"The Gulag Archipelago.\"\n\n&nbsp;\n\n3) Slave Labor\u2013You Get What You Pay For\n\n>\u201cWe made constant attempts at sabotage. Men whispered orders to impair the construction of the bridge wherever possible. Some charged with making up concrete mixtures deliberately added too much sand or not enough, which would later have disastrous effects.  \n\n\u2014 \u201cThe Forgotten Highlander\u201d Pg 188\n\nEvil leaders have been under the assumption that slave labor is a great way to accomplish projects at little to no costs, but this is far from the truth. As Urquhart writes in his book, the prisoners did everything in their power to delay or destroy the project. They even collected termites and white ants and deposited them into the grooves of the logs that were meant to hold up the bridge. As a result, construction projects were often delayed or if it were finished, the quality of the project was extremely poor and didn't last long.\n\nA similar conclusion can be found in the Soviet labor camps.\n\n>\u201cAll they were on the lookout for was ways to spoil their footgear\u2013and not go out to work; how to wreck a crane, to buckle a wheel, to break a spade, to sink a pail\u2013anything for a pretext to sit down and smoke.  \n\n\u2014 \u201cThe Gulag Archipelago\u201d Pg 293\n\nJust as in the Japanese camps, workers would constantly find ways to sabotage the project so they didn\u2019t have to work. Solzhenitsyn adds that the material was so poor, people could break bricks with their bare hands. \n\nThe prisoners did everything possible to quietly foil the project so that they wouldn\u2019t have to work\u2013after all, they weren\u2019t being paid to work so they didn\u2019t have any incentive to do so.\n\nThe prisoners were also constantly stealing project materials. Solzhenitsyn concludes the chapter by writing that the labor camps were not only ineffective, but they ended up costing the country more than if they had simply paid workers a fair wage. \n\n&nbsp; \n\n2) Life Is Unfair\n\n>Viktor Frankl worked at a hospital as a psychiatrist, before being arrested and sent to four different concentration camps over the years.  \n>Aleksander Solzhenitsyn was a decorated captain in the Soviet Army during World War II before he was arrested and sent to a labor camp for criticizing Stalin in private letters. \n>Alistair Urquhart was drafted into the army during WWII and shipped to the British outpost of Singapore before he was arrested by the Japanese and sent to one of their labor camps. \n\n \n\nNone of these men were \u201cevil\u201d or actual criminals. They were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. None of them deserved to suffer in the labor camps. None of them should have worked 16 hours a day of physical labor on barely any food or water in horrific conditions.\n\nLife is simply unfair at times. Viktor Frankl does, however, offer a piece of advice should anyone find themselves in a similar situation. He writes that everything can be taken from a person, except their attitude. \n\n>\u201cEverything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms\u2013to choose one\u2019s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one\u2019s own way...It is this spiritual freedom\u2013which cannot be taken away\u2013that makes life meaningful and purposeful. \n\n\u2014 \u201cMan\u2019s Search for Meaning\u201d Pg 66\nViktor Frankl, author of \"Man's Search for Meaning.\"\n\n&nbsp;\n\n1) Man is Capable of being a Saint & a Swine\n\n>\u201cIn the concentration camps...we watched and witnessed some of our comrades behave like swine while others behaved like saints. Man has both potentialities within himself, which one is actualized depends on decisions but not on conditions. \n\n\u2014 \u201cMan\u2019s Search for Meaning\u201d Pg 134\n\nThat is a heavy truth to swallow. Even in the concentration camps, Frankl noticed some prisoners gave their daily piece of bread to prisoners in dire need of nutrition. He also saw other miracles such as a Nazi doctor buying medical supplies with his own money and smuggling it back into camp to help the Jewish prisoners. \n\nFrankl ends the book by saying that man is capable of inventing the gas chambers of Auschwitz, but man is also the same being that entered those gas chambers with the Lord\u2019s prayer on their lips. \n\nSolzhenitsyn came to a similar conclusion in his book.\n\n>\u201cGradually it was disclosed to me that the line separating good and evil passes not through states, nor between classes, nor between political parties either\u2013but right through every human heart\u2013and through all human hearts.   \n\n\u2014 \u201cThe Gulag Archipelago\u201d Pg 312\n\nSolzhenitsyn spent countless hours thinking in prison\u2013when he wasn\u2019t being forced to work, prisoners sat in their cells and had nothing but their hands and their mind\u2013and came upon the realization that good and evil exists inside every person, but they must make the decision within themselves. \n\nInside every person is the struggle between good and evil, and although it is impossible to expel evil from the word, the next best thing is to constrict it within each person. That is a responsibility that falls upon each and every one of us. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nFeel free to agree to disagree with anything I've written. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nEDIT: Thank you for the Reddit Gold, it's my first one!

I was wondering if there are any other frameworks you find useful that we missed and should add to the list. I\u2019m copying the entire list here (each entry also has some sample code, but I\u2019m excluding that). Please let me know if you think we should add any framework. \n\n(and, if you\u2019d like to check out the full article, you can find it here: [A Beginner\u2019s Introduction to Python Web Frameworks](https://stxnext.com/blog/2018/09/27/beginners-introduction-python-frameworks/?utm_medium=social&utm_source=reddit&utm_campaign=2019-08-jd))\n\n## Django\n\n**The most popular Python framework is Django, hands down.** Django\u2019s trademark is that it offers all the tools you need to build a web application within a single package, from low- to high-end.\n\nDjango applications are based on a design pattern similar to MVC, the so-called MVT (Model-View-Template) pattern. Models are defined using the Django ORM, while SQL databases are mainly used as storage.\n\nDjango has a built-in admin panel, allowing for easy management of the database content. With minimal configuration, this panel is generated automatically based on the defined models.\n\nViews can include both functions and classes, and the assignment of URLs to views is done in one location (the urls.py file), so that after reviewing that single file you can learn which URLs are supported. Templates are created using a fairly simple Django Templates system.\n\nDjango is praised for strong community support and detailed documentation describing the functionality of the framework. This documentation coupled with getting a comprehensive environment after the installation makes the entry threshold rather low. Once you go through [the official tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/intro/tutorial01/), you\u2019ll be able to do most of the things required to build an application.\n\n**Unfortunately, Django\u2019s monolithism also has its drawbacks.** It is difficult, though not impossible, to replace one of the built-in elements with another implementation. For example, using some other ORM (like SQLAlchemy) requires abandoning or completely rebuilding such items as the admin panel, authorization, session handling, or generating forms.\n\nBecause Django is complete but inflexible, it is suitable for standard applications (i.e. the vast majority of software projects). However, if you need to implement some unconventional design, it leads to struggling with the framework, rather than pleasant programming.\n\n## Flask\n\nFlask is considered a microframework. It comes with basic functionality, while also allowing for easy expansion. Therefore, **Flask works more as the glue that allows you to join libraries with each other.**\n\nFor example, \u201cpure Flask\u201d does not provide support for any storage, yet there are many different implementations that you can install and use interchangeably for that purpose (such as Flask-SQLAlchemy, Flask-MongoAlchemy, and Flask-Redis). Similarly, the basic template system is Jinja2, but you can use a replacement (like Mako).\n\nThe motto of this framework is \u201cone drop at a time,\u201d and this is reflected in its comprehensive documentation. The knowledge of how to build an application is acquired in portions here; after reading a few paragraphs, you will be able to perform basic tasks.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to know the more advanced stuff right away\u2014you\u2019ll learn it once you actually need it. Thanks to this, students of Flask can gather knowledge smoothly and avoid boredom, making Flask suitable for learning.\n\n**A large number of Flask extensions, unfortunately, are not supported as well as the framework itself.** It happens quite often that the plug-ins are no longer being developed or their documentation is outdated. In cases like these, you need to spend some time googling a replacement that offers similar functionality and is still actively supported.\n\nWhen building your application with packages from different authors, you might have to put quite a bit of sweat into integrating them with each other. You will rarely find ready-made instructions on how to do this in the plug-ins\u2019 documentation, but in such situations the Flask community and websites such as Stack Overflow should be of help.\n\n## Pyramid\n\nPyramid, the third noteworthy Python web framework, is rooted in two other products that are no longer developed: Pylons and repoze.bfg. **The legacy left by its predecessors caused Pyramid to evolve into a very mature and stable project.**\n\nThe philosophies of Pyramid and Django differ substantially, even though both were released in the same year (2005). Unlike Django, Pyramid is trivial to customize, allowing you to create features in ways that the authors of the framework themselves hadn\u2019t foreseen. It does not force the programmer to use framework\u2019s idioms; it\u2019s meant to be a solid scaffolding for complex or highly non-standard projects.\n\nPyramid strives to be persistence-agnostic. While there is no bundled database access module, a common practice is to combine Pyramid with the powerful, mature SQLAlchemy ORM. Of course, that\u2019s only the most popular way to go. Programmers are free to choose whatever practices suit them best, such as using the peewee ORM, writing raw SQL queries, or integrating with a NoSQL database, just to name a few.\n\nAll options are open, though this approach requires a bit of experience to smoothly add the desired persistence mechanisms to the project. The same goes for other components, such as templating.\n\nOpenness and freedom are what Pyramid is all about. Modules bundled with it relate to the web layer only and users are encouraged to freely pick third-party packages that will support other aspects of their projects.\n\n**However, this model causes a noticeable overhead at the beginning of any new project,**because you have to spend some time choosing and integrating the tools your team is comfortable with. Still, once you put the effort into making additional decisions during the early stages of the work, you are rewarded with a setup that makes it easy and comfortable to start a new project and develop it further.\n\nPyramid is a self-proclaimed \u201cstart small, finish big, stay finished framework.\u201d This makes it an appropriate tool for experienced developers who are not afraid of playing the long game and working extra hard in the beginning, without shipping a single feature within the first few days. Less experienced programmers may feel a bit intimidated.\n\n## web2py\n\nCreated in 2007, web2py is a framework originally designed as a teaching tool for students, so the main concern for its authors was ease of development and deployment.\n\nWeb2py is strongly inspired by Django and Ruby on Rails, sharing the idea of **convention over configuration. In other words, web2py provides many** ***sensible defaults*** **that allow developers to get off the ground quickly.**\n\nThis approach also means there are a lot of goodies bundled with web2py. You will find everything you\u2019d expect from a web framework in it, including a built-in server, HTML-generating helpers, forms, validators, and many more\u2014nothing unusual thus far, one could argue. Support for multiple database engines is neat, though it\u2019s a pretty common asset among current web frameworks.\n\nHowever, some other bundled features may surprise you, since they are not present in other frameworks:\n\n* helpers for creating [JavaScript](https://stxnext.com/services/javascript-development/)\\-enabled sites with jQuery and Ajax;\n* scheduler and cron;\n* 2-factor authentication helpers;\n* text message sender;\n* an event-ticketing system, allowing for automatic assignment of problems that have occurred in the production environment to developers.\n\nThe framework proudly claims to be a full-stack solution, providing everything you could ever need.\n\nWeb2py has extensive documentation available online. It guides newcomers step by step, starting with a short introduction to the Python language. The introduction is seamlessly linked with the rest of the manual, demonstrating different aspects of web2py in a friendly manner, with lots of code snippets and screenshots.\n\n**Despite all its competitive advantages, web2py\u2019s community is significantly smaller than Django\u2019s, or even Pyramid\u2019s.** Fewer developers using it means your chances of getting help and support are lower. The official mailing list is mostly inactive.\n\nAdditionally\u2014and unfortunately\u2014web2py is not compatible with Python 3 at the moment. This state of things puts the framework\u2019s prospects into question, as support for Python 2 ends in 2020. This issue is being addressed on the project\u2019s github. [Here](https://github.com/web2py/web2py/issues/1353) is where you can track the progress.\n\n## Sanic\n\n**Sanic differs considerably from the aforementioned frameworks because unlike them, it is based on asyncio**\u2014Python\u2019s toolbox for asynchronous programming, bundled with the standard library starting from version 3.4.\n\nIn order to develop projects based on Sanic, you have to grasp the ideas behind asyncio first. This involves a lot of theoretical knowledge about coroutines, concurrent programming caveats, and careful reasoning about the data flow in the application.\n\nOnce you get your head around Sanic/asyncio and applies the framework to an appropriate problem, the effort pays off. Sanic is especially useful when it comes to handling long-living connections, such as websockets. If your project requires support for websockets or making a lot of long-lasting external API calls, Sanic is a great choice.\n\nAnother use case of Sanic is writing a \u201cglue-web application\u201d that can serve as a mediator between two subsystems with incompatible APIs. Note that it requires at least Python 3.5, though.\n\nThe framework is meant to be very fast. One of its dependencies is [uvloop](https://github.com/MagicStack/uvloop)\u2014an alternative, drop-in replacement for asyncio\u2019s not-so-good built-in event loop. Uvloop is a wrapper around libuv, the same engine that powers Node.js. According to the uvloop documentation, this makes asyncio work 2\u20134 times faster.\n\n**In terms of \u201cwhat\u2019s in the box,\u201d Sanic doesn\u2019t offer as much as other frameworks.** It is a microframework, just like Flask. Apart from routing and other basic web-related goodies like utilities for handling cookies and streaming responses, there\u2019s not much inside. Sanic imitates Flask, for instance by sharing the concept of Blueprints\u2014tiny sub-applications that allow developers to split and organize their code in bigger applications.\n\nSanic also won\u2019t be a good choice for simple CRUD applications that only perform basic database operations. It would just make them more complicated with no visible benefit.\n\n## Japronto\n\nHave you ever imagined handling 1,000,000 requests per second with Python?\n\nIt seems unreal, since Python isn\u2019t the fastest programming language out there. But when a brilliant move was made to add asyncio to the standard library, it opened up countless possibilities.\n\nJapronto is a microframework that leverages some of them. As a result, **this Python framework was able to cross the magical barrier of 1 million requests handled per second.**\n\nYou may still be at a loss as to how that is possible, exactly.\n\nIt all comes down to 2 aces up Japronto\u2019s sleeve: uvloop and PicoHTTPParser. Uvloop is an asyncio backend based on libuv, while PicoHTTPParser is a lightweight HTTP headers parser written in C. All core components of the framework are also implemented in C. A wide variety of low-level optimizations and tricks are used to tweak performance.\n\nJapronto is designed for special tasks that could not be accomplished with bloated mainstream frameworks. It is a perfect fit for problems where every nanosecond counts. Knowledgeable developers, obsessed with optimization, will reap all of its possible benefits.\n\nAdditionally, Japronto is meant to provide a solid foundation for microservices using REST APIs with minimal overhead. In other words, there\u2019s not much in the box. Developers only need to set up routing and decide which routes should use synchronous or asynchronous handlers.\n\nIt might seem counterintuitive, but if a request can be handled in a synchronous way, you shouldn\u2019t try to do it asynchronously, as the overhead of switching between coroutines will limit performance.\n\n**What is quite unfortunate is that Japronto is not being actively developed.** On the other hand, the project is licensed under MIT, and the author claims he is willing to accept any contributions. Like Sanic, the framework is meant to work with Python 3.5+ versions.\n\n## aiohttp\n\nAiohttp is another library based on asyncio, the modern Python toolkit for writing asynchronous code. **Not meant to be a framework in a strict sense, aiohttp is more of a toolbox, supplementing the async arsenal with everything related to HTTP.**\n\nThis means aiohttp is helpful not only for writing server applications, but also to clients. Both will benefit from asyncio\u2019s goodies, most of all the ability to handle thousands of connections at the same time, provided the majority of operations involves I/O calls.\n\nSuch powerful clients are great when you have to issue many API calls at once, for example for scraping web pages. Without asyncio, you would have to use threading or multiprocessing, which are harder to get right and require much more memory.\n\nApart from building standalone applications, aiohttp\u2019s clients are a great supplement to any asyncio-based application that needs to issue non-blocking HTTP calls. The same is true for websockets. Since they are part of the HTTP specification, you can connect to websocket servers and easily exchange messages with them.\n\nWhen it comes to servers, aiohttp gives you everything you can expect from a microframework. The features available out-of-the-box include routing, middleware, and signals. It may seem like it\u2019s very little, but it will suffice for a web server.\n\n\u201cWhat about the remaining functionalities?\u201d you may ask.\n\nAs far as those are concerned, you can build the rest of the functionalities using one or many asyncio-compatible libraries. You will find plenty of them using sources [like this one](https://github.com/timofurrer/awesome-asyncio).\n\nAiohttp is built with testing in mind. Developers who want to test an aiohttp-based application will find it extremely easy, especially with the aid of pytest.\n\nEven though aiohttp offers satisfactory performance by default, there are a few low-hanging fruits you can pick. For example, you can install additional libraries: cchardet and aiodns. Aiohttp will detect them automatically. You can also utilize the same uvloop that powers Sanic.\n\nLast but not least: **one definite advantage of aiohttp is that it is being actively maintained and developed.** Choosing aiohttp when you build your next application will certainly be a good call.\n\n## Twisted\n\nWith Twisted, Python developers were able to do async programming long before it was cool. Twisted is one of the oldest and most mature Python projects around.\n\nOriginally released in 2002, Twisted predates even PEP8, so the code of the project does not follow the famous code style guide recommendations. Admittedly, this may somewhat discourage people from using it these days.\n\nTwisted\u2019s heart is an event-driven networking engine called reactor. It is used for scheduling and calling user-defined callbacks.\n\nIn the beginning, developers had to use explicit callbacks by defining functions and passing them around separately for cases when an operation succeeded and when it failed.\n\nAlthough this technique was compelling, it could also lead to what we know from early JavaScript: callback hell. In other words, the resultant code was tough to read and analyze.\n\n**At some point, Twisted introduced inlineCallbacks\u2014the notation for writing asynchronous code that was as simple to read as regular, synchronous code.** This solution played very well with Python\u2019s syntax and greatly influenced modern async toolkit from the standard library, asyncio.\n\nThe greatest advantage of this framework is that although Twisted itself is just an engine with few bundled extensions, there are many additional extensions available to expand its functionality. They allow for both low-level network programming (TCP/USP) and high, application-level work (HTTP, IMAP, SHH, etc).\n\n**This makes Twisted a perfect choice for writing specialized services; however, it is not a good candidate for regular web applications.** Developers would have to write a lot of things on their own to get the functionality they take for granted with Django.\n\nTwisted is being actively maintained. There is an undergoing effort to migrate all of its code to be compatible with Python 3. The core functionality was rewritten some time ago, but many third-party modules are still incompatible with newer versions of the interpreter.\n\nThis may raise some concerns whether Twisted is the best choice for new projects. On the other hand, though, it is more mature than some asyncio-based solutions. Also, Twisted has been around for quite some time now, which means it will undoubtedly be maintained at least for a good while.\n\n## Falcon\n\nFalcon is another microframework on our list. The goal of the Falcon project is to create a minimalist foundation for building web apps where the slightest overhead matters.\n\nAuthors of the framework claim it is a **bare-metal, bloat-free toolkit for building very fast backend code and microservices.** Plus, it is compatible with both Python 2 and 3.\n\nA big advantage of Falcon is that it is indeed very fast. Benchmarks published on its website show an incredible advantage over mainstream solutions like Django or Flask.\n\nThe downside, though, is that **Falcon offers very little to start with.** There\u2019s routing, middlewares, hooks\u2014and that\u2019s basically everything. There are no extras: no validation, no authentication, etc. It is up to the developer to extend functionality as needed.\n\nFalcon assumes it will be used for building REST APIs that talk JSON. If that is the case, you really need literally zero configuration. You can just sit down and code.\n\nThis microframework might be an exciting proposition for implementing highly-customized services that demand the highest performance possible. Falcon is an excellent choice when you don\u2019t want or can\u2019t invest in asyncio-based solutions.\n\nIf you\u2019re thinking, \u201cSometimes the simplest solution is the best one,\u201d you should definitely consider Falcon.\n\n## API Star\n\nAPI Star is the new kid on the block. It is yet another microframework, but this one is compatible with Python 3 only. Which is not surprising, because it leverages type hints introduced in Python 3.5.\n\n**API Star uses type hints as a notation for building validation schemata in a concise, declarative way.** Such a schema (called a \u201cType\u201d in the framework\u2019s terminology) can then be bound to request a handling function.\n\nAdditionally, API Star features automatically generated API docs. They are compatible with OpenAPI 3. Such docs can facilitate communication between API authors and its consumers, i.e. frontend developers. If you use the Types we\u2019ve mentioned, they are included in the API docs.\n\nAnother outstanding feature is the dependency injection mechanism. It appears to be an alternative to middlewares, but smarter and much more powerful.\n\nFor example, you can write a so-called Component that will provide our views with a currently authenticated User. On the view level, you have to explicitly state that it will require a User instance.\n\nThe rest happens behind the scenes. API Star resolves which Components have to be executed to finally run our view with all the required information.\n\nThe advantage that automatic dependency injection has over regular middlewares is that Components do not cause any overhead for the views where they are not used.\n\nLast but not least, API Star can also be run atop asyncio in a more traditional, synchronous, WSGI-compliant way. **This makes it probably the only popular framework in the Python world capable of doing that.**\n\nThe rest of the goodies bundled with API Star are pretty standard: optional support for templating with jinja2, routing, and event hooks.\n\nAll in all, API Star looks extremely promising. At the time of writing, it has over 4,500 stars in its GitHub repository. The repository already has a few dozen contributors, and pull requests are merged daily. Many of us at STX Next are keeping our fingers crossed for this project!\n\n## Other Python web development frameworks\n\nThere are many more Python web frameworks out there you might find interesting and useful. Each of them focuses on a different issue, was built for distinct tasks, or has a particular history.\n\nThe first that comes to mind is **Zope2,** one of the oldest frameworks, still used mainly as part of the Plone CMS. **Zope3** (later renamed BlueBream) was created as Zope2\u2019s successor. The framework was supposed to allow for easier creation of large applications, but hasn\u2019t won too much popularity, mainly because of the need to master fairly complex concepts (e.g. Zope Component Architecture) very early in the learning process.\n\nAlso noteworthy is the **Google App Engine,** which allows you to run applications written in Python, among others. This platform lets you create applications in any framework compatible with WSGI. The SDK for the App Engine includes a simple framework called webapp2, and this exact approach is often used in web applications adapted to this environment.\n\nAnother interesting example is **Tornado,** developed by FriendFeed and made available by Facebook. This framework includes libraries supporting asynchronicity, so you can build applications that support multiple simultaneous connections (like long polling or WebSocket).\n\nOther libraries similar to Tornado include **Pulsar** (async) and **Gevent** (greenlet). These libraries allow you to build any network applications (multiplayer games and chat rooms, for example). They also perform well at handling HTTP requests.\n\nDeveloping applications using these frameworks and libraries is more difficult and requires you to explore some harder-to-grasp concepts. We recommend getting to them later on, as you venture deeper into the wonderful world of Python.\n\n\\----------------\n\nThis is the full list we came up with.

With a few lines of only Python code, you can create interactive websites without any JavaScript programming. Comes with a comprehensive tutorial # JustPy\n\n[JustPy Docs and Tutorials](https://justpy.io)\n\n## Introduction\n\nJustPy is an object-oriented, component based, high-level Python Web Framework that requires no front-end programming. With a few lines of only Python code, you can create interactive websites without any JavaScript programming.\n\nUnlike other web frameworks, JustPy has no front-end/back-end distinction. All programming is done on the back-end allowing a simpler, more productive, and more Pythonic web development experience. JustPy removes the front-end/back-end distinction by intercepting the relevant events on the front-end and sending them to the back-end to be processed.\n\nIn JustPy, elements on the web page are instances of component classes. A component in JustPy is a Python class that allows you to instantiate reusable custom elements whose functionality and design is encapsulated away from the rest of your code.\n\nCustom components can be created using other components as building blocks. Out of the box, JustPy comes with support for [HTML](https://justpy.io/#/tutorial/html_components) and [SVG](https://justpy.io/#/tutorial/svg_components) components as well as more complex components such as [charts](https://justpy.io/#/charts_tutorial/introduction) and [grids](https://justpy.io/#/grids_tutorial/introduction).  It also supports most of the components and the functionality of the [Quasar](https://quasar.dev/) library of [Material Design 2.0](https://material.io/) components.\n\nJustPy encourages creating your own components and reusing them in different projects (and, if applicable, sharing these components with others).\n\nJustPy supports visualization using [matplotlib](https://justpy.io/#/tutorial/matplotlib) and [Highcharts](https://justpy.io/#/charts_tutorial/introduction).\n\nJustPy integrates nicely with [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and simplifies building web sites based on pandas analysis. JustPy comes with a [pandas extension](https://justpy.io/#/charts_tutorial/pandas?id=using-the-pandas-extension) that makes it simple to create interactive charts and grids from pandas data structures.\n\nFor updates and news please follow the [JustPy Twitter account](https://twitter.com/justpyframework)\n\n## Hello World!\n\n    import justpy as jp\n    \n    def hello_world():\n        wp = jp.WebPage()\n        d = jp.Div(text='Hello world!')\n        wp.add(d)\n        return wp\n        \n    jp.justpy(hello_world)\n\nThe program above activates a web server that returns a web page with 'Hello world!' for any request. Locally, you would direct your browser to [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) or http://localhost:8000/ or  to see the result.\n\nHere is a slightly modified version in which 'Hello world!' changes to 'I was clicked!' when it is clicked.\n\n    import justpy as jp\n    \n    def my_click(self, msg):\n        self.text = 'I was clicked!'\n    \n    def hello_world():\n        wp = jp.WebPage()\n        d = jp.Div(text='Hello world!')\n        d.on('click', my_click)\n        wp.add(d)\n        return wp\n    \n    jp.justpy(hello_world)\n\nMany other examples can be found in the [tutorial](https://justpy.io/#/tutorial/getting_started)\n\n## Under the Hood\n\nJustPy's backend is built using:\n\n* [starlette](https://www.starlette.io/) \\- \"a lightweight [ASGI](https://asgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) framework/toolkit, which is ideal for building high performance asyncio services\".\n* [uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/) \\- \"a lightning-fast [ASGI](https://asgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) server, built on [uvloop](https://github.com/MagicStack/uvloop) and [httptools](https://github.com/MagicStack/httptools)\".\n\nJustPy's frontend (which is transparent to JustPy developers) is built using:\n\n* [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) \\- \"The Progressive JavaScript Framework\"\n\nThe way JustPy removes the frontend/backend distinction is by intercepting the relevant events on the frontend and sending them to the backend to be processed.\n\n## License\n\n[Apache License, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt)"}, {"subreddit": "music", "label": 6, "post": "Who else thinks the new Gorillaz single \"Hallelujah Money\" is complete garbage?

More info at [github.com/juftin/camply](https://github.com/juftin/camply).\n\nMy partner and I are taking a trip this summer (July, 2021) from home in Colorado through Wyoming to Glacier National Park. Like all national parks right now, the campsites in Glacier are a hot commodity and tough to come by.\n\nTo help us get an advantage in finding a site we signed up for [*Campnab*](https://campnab.com/), a service that lets you sign up for text notifications when booked out campgrounds receive cancellations. Long story short, it's totally worth it I have nothing but great things to say about it. We found a 5 day cancellation and booked our first choice campground within a couple weeks of signing up for text alerts.\n\nOn our way home from Glacier we'll be going through Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Park. Unfortunately, Campnab doesn't (currently) work for most sites in Yellowstone, since they use a different booking provider than the rest of the National Park System. Instead, I decided to play around with the booking website and build my own integration with their API. It runs in a docker container, and sends push notifications through [Pushover](https://pushover.net/).\n\nFeature Requests and Technical Feedback / Questions are best done though the [Issues Page](https://github.com/juftin/yellowstone-camping/issues). Some basic command line skills and an always-on computer are required to run this.\n\nWe're still waiting for our Yellowstone spot as of writing this and can't wait to get back there this summer.

Now, using farm animals is a genius way of framing a governmental revolution, but the characters are, for lack of a better term, not characters.\n\nWhat I mean by that is they aren\u2019t written for the reader to care about them. They\u2019re written for the purpose of the allegory, which again, *is not necessarily a bad thing.* The characters accomplish their purposes well, one of many realms *Animal Farm* is so well known. \n(I will say my heart twinged a bit when you-know-What happened to Boxer.)\n\nAnother shorter example of characters (and by extension books) being used for solely allegory is *Fahrenheit 451.* The world described within the story is basically a well written way of Ray Bradbury saying \u201cI think TV and no books will be the death of us all.\u201d \n\n(*1984* is also an example of characters for allegory.)\n\nOn the other hand, it seems newer dystopians are written more with the characters in mind- a well known example is *The Hunger Games.* Say what you will about the overall quality of the book, I think it\u2019s safe to say it does a pretty good job of balancing its social commentary and love triangles.\n\nLast example is *Munmun.* It\u2019s only two years old, but basically it\u2019s about poor siblings Warner and Prayer, who live in an alternate reality where every person's physical size is directly proportional to their wealth. The book chronicles their attempts to \u201cscale up\u201d by getting enough money (to avoid being eaten by rats and trampled and such.)\n\nBeing an incredibly imaginative book aside(highly recommend it), the author does an amazing job of using the story as a very harsh metaphor on capitalism, class, wealth, etc while still keeping tge readers engaged and caring about the main characters.\n\nIn short, instead of the characters being in the story for sake of allegory, the characters and story are **enriched** by allegory.\n\nI have a few theories on why this change towards story and characters has happened:\n\n**-** once dystopians became mainstream authors realized they could actually tell realistic human stories in these dystopian worlds \n**-** most genres change over time, dystopian is no exception \n**-** younger people read these dystopian books and identified with the fears expressed in them. Seeing this, publishers or authors or someone then wrote/commissioned new dystopias, but with the allegory and social commentary watered down and sidelined for romance, character, and story, in order to make it more palatable for younger readers.\n\n([Here\u2019s a link](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/c9okhi/new_dystopias_are_more_story_focused_because/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) to where I go into more depth in this last thought)\n\nIf you\u2019re still reading this, wow and thanks! What do you think? Anyone had similar thoughts or reading experiences? Anyone agree or disagree? Comment away and let me know!\n\nEdit: to be clear, I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s a bad thing older dystopians use characters for allegory purposes, I\u2019m just pointing it out. So please no one say \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter if the characters are flat!\u201d I know, human. I know.\n\nSecond Edit: someone linked this article, it talks about what I\u2019ve noticed, the supposed [decline of dystopian/philosophical novels ](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/20/books/review/whatever-happened-to-the-novel-of-ideas.html) (I can\u2019t remember who linked it, so whoever did, claim credit!)\n\nThird Edit: some grammar, and a few new ideas"}, {"subreddit": "gaming", "label": 3, "post": "Fought my first Legendary Dragon after over 3,000 hours into this game.

Here's a recording, should anybody be interested (the reading starts about at around 8:30 in): http://mixlr.com/happy-tentacle-radio/showreel/the-stories-we-share-the-little-prince/\n\nLet me preface this post by apologizing if it breaks any rules in this sub. I did read them, but I feel this post is in a grey area. It goes without saying, I understand if you delete the post if I trespass on the rules. I would appreciate a recommendation to a suitable subreddit if that is the case.\n\nThat out of the way. As the title says, I feel the age old tradition of reading to each other has faded away, and I think it's a tragedy. There is something about having someone read or tell you a story. There is this magical combination of the way the story is told, shaped by the tone and tempo if the voice, and your own imagination. The magic is that something happens that would not have occurred if you \"simply\" read the story yourself. It comes to life in another way, and for many it's less straining on your concentration. Others don't like to read by themselves.\n\nAudio books are a great way to get a similar experience, but to me they lack the feeling that the book is read, in this moment, to you. You miss the facial expressions of the reader, or the gestures that underline certain points.\n\nI personally read very often to my family. Whether that be a night time story for the kids or something more fitting for my wife after we've gone to bed. It's a kind of quality time I wouldn't miss for the world.\n\nBesides storytelling, another big passion of mine - that used to be me my professional occupation - is music. I love finding new and obscure music and especially - sharing it with others. \n\nI've combined those two passions in a hobby of mine, where I do live recordings from passages of books, poems and such, while I at the same time mix music that matches the mood and the progression of the stories I read. It's a hobby that consumes a lot of time, because I insist on doing it all live. I literally put days into the preparation... And I've been told it shows. \n\nI realize it's dreadfully presumptuous of me to assume any of you might be interested, but the whole sharing part is one of the main pillars that drives this hobby. Which is why I invite anyone interested to join me, and my regular listeners this Sunday at 21:00 CET (15:00 ET I believe) for a live reading of Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's \"The Little Prince\".\n\nThis book is to me something of a miracle of a short book. The layers of meaning and the depths of its wisdom make it a book you cannot read or be read to too many times. There's always something new to learn.\n\nLet me underline this is hobby-based. There is **no** profit-making, advertisements or the like involved. Nothing. I'm just some dude who loves books, storytelling and music, who'd like to share that love with other people.\n\nSo the oblig links are as follows:\nThe live broadcast can be heard here on Sunday: http://mixlr.com/happy-tentacle-radio\n\nTo hear a past broadcast where I read passages from Neil Gaiman's \"American Gods\" and  Alexandre Dumas' \"The Count of Monte Cristo\"(I start reading about 6 minutes in): http://mixlr.com/happy-tentacle-radio/showreel/the-stories-we-share-with-dj-chemic\n\nThanks for reading. I hope I get a chance to read for you in turn.\n\nEdit: I'm a bit overwhelmed with all the heart warming, fun and super interesting messages people have posted here. I've tried to answer as many as I can, but it's Friday night, the kids are in bed, and I'm going to spend some quality time with the wife. I'll come back tomorrow. But let me extend my deepest, heart-felt thank you for taking time to share all your memories and experiences!"}, {"subreddit": "politics", "label": 7, "post": "Biden Bars Trump From Intelligence Briefings "}, {"subreddit": "python", "label": 1, "post": "Laid off for 8 weeks.

I went to bed hoping a couple of people max would find this interesting! Your comments have been super useful and the fact that some of you went out and used the bot has also made me see some of the current limitations:\n\n1. Stock splits are not currently supported. If a user generates a reminder for a stock that  undergoes a split before the reminder date, the results will show a large decrease in stock price, when this might not be the case. EDIT - stock splits now supported!\n2. Similarly, the returns % is calculated without accounting inflation or dividends\n3. The bot doesn't quite support intra-day trading. So a mention like \"Remind me of $BTC in one hour\" will generate the initial reply but the bot won't trigger the reminder unless the bot is mentioned before midday UTC.\n\n\\*I've now added support for stock splits:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nvtibqrt8s761.png?width=1322&format=png&auto=webp&s=c06b1ec7a5b5d12bd1bb55b0db9d76f33fa083e4"}, {"subreddit": "gaming", "label": 3, "post": "Video games are great, but sometimes it's nice to unplug and play a game of Jenga with your cat "}, {"subreddit": "python", "label": 1, "post": "Django 2.0 (now on master) will not support Python 2 "}, {"subreddit": "science", "label": 2, "post": "Dogs may never learn that every sound of a word matters.

Thought I'd use an independent book shop so they would get my money and not a big corporation like Amazon...\n\nThey had to order them in as they don't stock them.. Understandable. \nThey finally came in after a week or so and were shipped out via pretty slow mail method.. Okay fair enough, faster is costly I guess.\nAfter over a week of waiting only half actually arrived. So now the whole process has to be started again for the missing books.\n\nSo far it's taken the best part of two weeks and I only have half of what I originally ordered.\n\nI'm not complaining as such as I prefer these people get the money and not big corporations but it's pretty obvious that a good majority of people wouldn't put up with this when you can just buy on Amazon and have the item pretty much next day.\n\nAnyway, this is just my personal experience of trying to shop away from Amazon etc and my thoughts about it. It won't stop me from using independent sellers but it has given me insight.\n\n\nEdit. Again I just want to make clear, this post is just intended to promote open discussion about the subject and my observations of buying. This observation won't put me off buying local and independent. \n\n**Edit 2. Never expected this to go this mad, sorry I can't reply to everyone but I've very much enjoyed everyone's input and discussion. I'd just like to add that this was never intended as a witch hunt against people using either option, just as a discussion about the issues surrounding both.**\n\n\n**PS.

I grabbed it quick and hoped that she would begin reading it soon.  Then the thought occurred to me, why not read it to her?  I haven't read a book to my daughter in years.  I read the first chapter and she was enthralled.  Having read the series myself years ago I knew what was going to happen and reading it aloud I am able to put the right inflections into the parts as they are needed.  And to say she's enjoying it is not even close.\n\nSince that night I have read a single chapter to her each evening, sometimes staying up past her bedtime to ensure she gets the prerequisite chapter finished.  When we get to the end of the chapter she is begging for more.\n\nAs a parent I know that in the future when she is much older and has kids of her own she will think back to this time in her life fondly.  It warms my heart to know that I am making a memory that will last her lifetime and it is even more special because I know it now.\n\n\nEdit:  Wow, Front Page and Gold!

This means there is 1 bookstore which is a chain of bookstores that give you the standard low effort help and enthusiasm and a few second hand stores who also happen to sell used books no one wants.\n\nThe bookstore wasn't perfect, it didn't have much room to move around in nor did it have a lounge area where you could sit down like some new bookstores are doing. But the owner and the employees were helpful with a wide breath of knowledge and very happy about their job, willing to share everything.\n\nI remember around 10 years ago I was very into detective novels and wanted to read Arsene Lupin but couldn't find it anywhere online in Sweden or any bookstore. But I went there and they managed to find a copy, ordered it for me and let me check out the contents for a few minutes before I had to pay. I read that book around the time my great grandmother passed away and I won't forget about either of them for as long as I live.\n\nThere was no new owner of the bookstore and we won't be getting another one.

The advice is to simply scan the words in a text with the result of increasing reading speed dramatically while maintaining comprehension. This is false and terrible advice. \n\nA [large review](https://journals.sagepub.com/stoken/rbtfl/0GSjhNaccRKTY/full) of the science behind reading shows that suppressing the inner voice, also called subvocalization, is detrimental to comprehension. Trying to remove it to improve reading speed will ironically make you a worse reader.\n\nThe study concludes that there is no magic bullet for reading quickly and actually understanding what you are reading. There exists a fundamental trade-off between speed and accuracy in reading. If you seek a specific piece of information and know the material beforehand, it makes sense to skim. If you want to read for comprehension and retention, do so with normal reading. \n\nSo is there a way to read faster while understanding? The review states that reading is based on language, rather than a purely visual process. Language skill is therefore at the heart of reading speed. Read more, read different kinds of text and improve your vocabulary to enhance your reading speed.\n\n*Note:* This post is specifically about the effects of subvocalization elimination on reading speed and comprehension, not other techniques in speed reading such as the elimination or reduction of eye movements. Nonetheless, there is reason to be skeptical about these techniques as well, see the above-cited paper.\n\n**tl;dr (or speed read)**:  suppressing your inner voice while reading is bad if you want to understand what you read.\n\nEnglish is not my first language, sorry for any mistakes.\n\nedit 1: fixing spelling mistakes\n\nedit 2: some people seem to be conflating *speed reading* with simply *reading quickly*. They are not the same.

The whole app can be controlled just using a keyboard. No need to use your mouse. This way, it\u2019s easier to stay in the flow.\n\nThe app works similarly to Spotlight on macOS. You hit a global shortcut and Devbook appears as an overlay over the currently active app. This way you minimalize the needed context switching when looking up information. You almost don't leave your coding editor.\n\nYou can think about Devbook as a search engine made just for developers. But no ads, content marketing, SEO, etc.\n\nI thought the community here might find it useful. Currently, we support Python, Flask, Django docs, and adding more with time.\n\nGive it a try and let me know what you think!\n\n**EDIT**\n\nSome folks have been asking us for the pricing. Devbook is free. The plan is to build team features later on and have subscriptions for teams and organizations. If it will be possible, we want to always have a free plan for solo developers.\n\nHowever, if you really want to support us, I just set up the [Buy Me A Coffee page](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/P8dyVmoAF) for Devbook. You can donate a small amount if you feel comfortable. It will probably make us jump around from the excitement since it would be our first revenue:)\n\n**EDIT 2**\n\nOh, boy did this blow-up! Every week, we just share Devbook in various subreddits we think might enjoy it. We didn't expect to blow it up that much at all. Thank you all folks for trying Devbook out. It means a lot.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor the near future Devbook release, we're building an extensions system that will allow you to add search functionality we don't support out of the box.

My point is that most (or at least many) of us no longer care to have LPs, CDs, or even MP3s lying around. I have never used or wanted band merch, and I simply don't get a chance to see bands I really like that often. So my point, once again, was to have a feature to DONATE to the artist (without getting anything physical, in return) through the platform that I listen to music on, which I realize doesn't pay smaller artists that well. \n\nAlso to clarify, I understand that a lot of work goes into writing/recording/putting out a record; in a perfect world, this theoretical donation could be split between the artist and their label/legal/creative team however they saw fit. \n\n\nEDIT: Wow!

As of December 5th, Soundcloud has announced that upload limits will not be changed this upcoming Monday. This means the world to thousands of small time creators and is appreciated deeply; Thank you for listening to your content creators and I am deeply humbled that I could help voice some of the community's concerns. \n\nI think we can all breathe a sigh or relief now and get back to making music. Thanks for the support everyone\n\n[Thank You SC!](https://soundcloud.com/user-975550966/thank-you-soundcloud-upcoming-user-limitations-have-been-prevented)\n---\n\nSoundcloud is a website that was built by small time creators. It rose in popularity as an avenue for producers and musicians to share their art in an accessible environment. If you've heard of a small time musician, chances are they got some of their start on Soundcloud.\n\n*Which is why is heartbreaking that they've made the decision to kill off the majority of their users*\n\n>starting December 9th, our free upload limit will change from 3 hours of audio, to 3 hours or 15 tracks.\n\n**15 tracks...**\n\nThis essentially means even if you were nowhere near the original upper limit of 3 hours of upload time, then your account will be frozen. Virtually every creator/producer that has been with the site for any considerable amount of time is either well, well above 15 tracks (many only under 3 minutes each) or right on the cusp of hitting 15 tracks.\n\nThe only option to circumvent this crippling new limitation is to pay for their \"Pro Unlimited\" program, costing $12-$16 a month\n\n#Thats ~ $150 - $190 a year\n\nI would have no problem paying for the service if it wasn't so insultingly costly with virtually no benefit to the Artist, beyond now being the *only* way to use the site if youre a creator\n\nIf this new implementation goes through on December 9th, then Soundcloud will become a shell of what it used to be; users will leave for other platforms in droves and everyone will be worse for it. How many starving artists do you know that have $150 to dish out every year for a service that can easily be replaced by Youtube and Bandcamp in tangent. \n\nIn short, RIP Soundcloud. Cause of death: Suicide\n\n---\n\n**Edit:** I can't keep replying to individuals calling Soundcloud users 'entitled whiny soundcloud rappers,' so I'll leave this here: Services cost money, that is common sense and no one is trying to ignore that. If Soundcloud came forward with a message saying \"Sorry guys, ads aren't cutting it, if you want more upload time then you need to pay something,\" That would be understandable and fair. $5-$10 for music hosting is reasonable.\n\nInstead this entire thing is covered with underhanded business practices. Weeks before this, they slowly rolled back their \"Pro\" membership, an option for more storage among other things that was a lot more affordable than \"Pro Unlimited.\" Pro is no longer an option on their store, meaning the $150-$190 a year plan is the only option. Then they hit us with the 15 track limit, which in practice lowers the 3 hour upload limit for free users down to 30-45 minutes. Soundcloud planned this, to effectively strong arm as many users, users who have committed years of efforts into building the site into what it is, into the most expensive plan possible in a financial hail mary. The company itself is in dire straits financially, and it seems theyve decided their best way out is by throwing their long term users under the bus.\n\nNo one is trying to act entitled, I would happily contribute towards the site if the costs were representative of the services they offer, but coming from a musician who has loved the site despite its flaws for years, I feel deeply betrayed. I'm sure these sentiments are shared by the thousands of small creators who will have their accounts effectively frozen on Dec. 9th. \n\nThis situation is disheartening to small content creators everywhere.\n\n---\n\n**Edit 2:** Personally, I do not think there is much power behind a petition. Regardless, upon the suggestion of a few users who share similar concerns and eagerness to do something to stop this, I have put together a petition expressing public desire to prevent the harm these changes will have on Soundcloud and its loyal content creators.\n\nhttp://chng.it/LH8yHsTJ9g\n\nSignatures would be appreciated, if only to show that the decision Soundcloud has made is not one that people will resign to and take quietly. \n\nThis situation is unfortunate, but I am appreciative of those who understand the plight these small time artists are now facing. \n\nI will make a separate post for the petition tomorrow. For now, thanks to those who have been civil in discussion of this matter.\n\n---\n\n**Final Edit** \n\nThe post detailing the petition is now live:\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/e62azy/update_petition_soundcloud_is_quietly_forcing_out/?\n\nAny support would be appreciated.

Don't write OOP and class-based python unless I am doing more than 100 lines of code. Most often write pretty simple stuff but most of the time goes into problem-solving.\n\nBut I despise freelancing. 1 out of every 3 comments/posts I make on Reddit is how much I hate doing freelancing. I come to Reddit to vent so I am sorry to the fellas who is reading this because they are more or less my punching bag :( I am sorry sir/madam. I am just having a bad life, it will end soon.\n\nSo, today I am going to rant about one of the more \"\"fun\"\" things of freelancing, client telling me they know python.\n\nWhenever a client tells me that they know python, I try to ignore them but often times I have to entertain the idea anyway because jobs are scarce. I keep telling myself \"maybe this will work out great\" but it doesn't.\n\nIt never goes right. Here is the thing. If you do what I do you will realize the code is often quite simple. Most of the effort goes into problem-solving. So when the client sees the code and me getting paid by the hour, \"They are like I thought you are *best darn python developer* I could have written that myself!\"\n\nMy immediate impulse is to go on a rant and call that person something rotten. But I have to maintain \"professionalism\".\n\nThen there is the issue of budgeting. I do fixed payment contracts for smaller engagements. But oftentimes these python experts will quote me something that is at least one-fourth of a reasonable budget. And by reasonable I mean non-US reasonable budget which is already one-fifth of a reasonable US programming project budget. But anyway they quote that because they know how is easy it is to do my job.\n\nThere is more because this is rant by the way. So, clients with python knowledge will say to me \"I have this python file...\" which is the worst thing to say at this point. They think they have done the \"majority\" of the work. But here is the way I see it-\n\na. Either they have just barely scratched the surface\nb. They have a jumbled up mess\nc. They had another dev look into the project who already failed\nd. They had to do a \"code review\" of their previous freelancer and they ended up stealing the code\n\nThere is no positive way to imagine this problem. I have seen too much crappy code and too much of arguments like \"they had done the work for me, so I should charge near to nothing\".\n\nPeople don't know exactly why senior devs get paid so much money. Junior devs write code, senior devs review code. That is why they get paid more. Making sense of other people's code is a risky and frustrating thing and it could be incredibly time-consuming. And moreover in most cases building upon a codebase is more difficult than writing it from the scratch.\n\nDoctors rant about \"expert\" patients earning their MDs from WebMD and I am seeing the exact same thing happen to me with clients knowing how to write loops in python.\n\nPython is easy to learn, programming these days is easy to learn. But people are not paying programmers for writing loops and if statements. They are paying them to solve problems. Knowing the alphabet doesn't make you a poet. And yes in my eyes programming is poetry."}, {"subreddit": "politics", "label": 7, "post": "In a loss for Trump, judge says woman who accused him of rape can proceed with defamation suit "}, {"subreddit": "politics", "label": 7, "post": "Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago neighbours initiate legal action to stop him moving there when he leaves White House.

[Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)  \\- One of the most renowned and recommended books for complete beginners to programming. Suggested for newer and medium programmers equally.\n2. [Official Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) \\- As said by many experienced programmers, the best way to learn any language is to go over the official documentation once. No tutorial can go over all the syntax and libraries in Python. So, for thorough understanding of Python, this is the way to go.\n3. [FreeCodeCamp Tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/python-for-everybody/introduction-why-program) \\- This is one of the most popular sites with 300+ hours of experienced teaching for free along with a Course Completion Certificate which you can use for your CVV, all for free.\n4. [SoloLearn Courses](https://www.sololearn.com/learning) \\- This site is pretty basic and contains MCQ questions and a single programming question after one module. It has Python For Beginners, Python For Intermediates, Python Core and Python for Data Science. Overall recommended for beginners.\n5. [FreeCodeCamp X Giraffe Academy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw&vl=en) \\- One of the best one's out there to get a kick start with Python. Teaches you all the basic recommended Syntax and explains them well too, unlike other's doesn't just make you copy paste code.\n6. [Telusko](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsyeobzWxl7poL9JTVyndKe62ieoN-MZ3) \\- Not as popular or renowned as the other tutorials recommended above, but still worth watching.\n7. [Cheat Sheet](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python/) \\- Not exactly a tutorial, it's a cheat sheet with all the essential syntax and their explanations.\n8. [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) \\- This is also not a tutorial. This is a place where you can ask your questions regarding Python. But please, before asking questions on Reddit or Stack Overflow, check your code twice or thrice and then google it. Even after that, if you can't solve the problem, send your question on Reddit and/or Stack Overflow.\n\n**None of the above tutorials and information is mine** and is the property of their respective owners.

It claims that [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com) violates the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act and infringes on Comcast\u2019s trademarks. Of course, these claims are legally baseless, since the site is clearly a form of First Amendment protected political speech and makes no attempt to impersonate Comcast. (See the case \"[Bosley Medical Institute vs. Kremer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosley_Medical_Institute,_Inc._v._Kremer)\" which held that a site critical of a company\u2019s practices could not be considered trademark infringement, or the case Taubman vs. Webfeats, which decided that *sucks.com domain names\u2014in this case taubmansucks.com\u2014were free speech)\n\n[Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com) criticizes the cable lobby and encourages Internet users to search the Federal Communication Commission (FCC)\u2019s docket to check if a fake comment was submitted using their name and address to attack Title II based net neutrality protections. It has been [widely reported](https://www.bna.com/fcc-set-move-n73014451155/) that more than 450,000 of these comments have been submitted to the FCC -- and as a result of the site at [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com), Fight for the Future [has heard](https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2017-05-18-fcc-ignores-growing-evidence-of-fraud-moves-ahead/) from dozens of people who say that anti-net neutrality comments were submitted using their personal information without their permission. We have connected individuals with Attorneys Generals and have called for the FCC act immediately to investigate this potential fraud.\n\nCompanies like Comcast have a long history of funding shady astroturfing operations like the one we are trying to expose with [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com), and also a long history of engaging in censorship. This is exactly why we need net neutrality rules, and why we can\u2019t trust companies like Comcast to just \"behave\" when they have abused their power time and time again.\n\nFight for the Future has no intention of taking down [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com), and we would be happy to discuss the matter with Comcast in court.\n"}, {"subreddit": "politics", "label": 7, "post": "AOC says people who think raising minimum wage is a \u2018crazy, socialist agenda' are living in a 'dystopian capitalist nightmare' "}, {"subreddit": "politics", "label": 7, "post": "James Mattis Denounces President Trump, Describes Him as a Threat to the Constitution "}, {"subreddit": "politics", "label": 7, "post": "Mitch McConnell just adjourned the Senate until November 9, ending the prospect of additional coronavirus relief until after the election "}, {"subreddit": "sports", "label": 8, "post": "Sidecar co-pilots hugging the corners at the Scarborough Gold Cup.

Over France, a few German fighter planes flew at them backwards, sucked bullets and shell fragments from some of the planes and crewmen. They did the same for wrecked American bombers on the ground, and those planes flew up backwards to join the formation.\nThe formatioin flew backwards over a German city that was in flames. The bombers opened their bomb bay doors, exerted a miraculous magnetism which shrunk the fires, gathered them into cylindrical steel containers, and lifted the containers into the bellies of the planes. The containers were stored neatly in racks. The Germans below had miraculous devices of their own, which were long steel tubes. They used them to suck more fragments from the crewmen and planes. But there were still a few wounded Americans, though, and some of the bombers were in bad repair. Over France, though, German fighters came up again, made everything and everybody as good as new.\n\nWhen the bombers got back to their base, the steel cylinders were taken from the racks and shipped back to the United States of America, where factories were operating night and day, dismantling the cylinders, separating the dangerous contents into minerals. Touchingly, it was mainly women who did this work. The minerals were then shipped to specialists in remote areas. \nIt was their business to put them into the ground, to hide them cleverly, so they would never hurt anybody ever again.\""}, {"subreddit": "books", "label": 4, "post": "Decided to set myself a goal of 25 books this year.

I've always used them but something I never understood was how they were made or where they were coming from. I did the research on how to design my library and publish it and immediately started.  I plan on maintaining the library and dealing with any issues or concerns everyday.\n\nAn issue I thought  mathematicians faced in programming was the incapability to draw graphs and models in a short period of time within their code.  With some research, I gathered a list of functions I wanted to implement to begin with. I have no calculus experience but I was determined to add a couple calculus functions. I needed a lot of help to understand the math and google came pretty clutch.\n\n**libmaths is an extremely efficient library allowing the user a smooth experience in graphing and modeling functions.

Fail\n* Science Gibberish? Minimal\n* Very enjoyable - good, concise world-building.  And an excellent job making a protagonist who is a bad guy... but you still want him to win.  Romantic plotline is unnecessary and feels very groomingy.  Sharp writing.\n\n1954 - They'd Rather Be Right by  Mark Clifton & Frank Riley\n\n* What if computers could fix anything, even people?\n* Worth a read? No\n* Primary Driver (Plot, **World**, or Character)\n* Bechdel Test? Fail\n* Science Gibberish? Heaps\n* This book is straight up not good.  An almost endless stream of garbage science mixed with some casual sexism.  Don't read it.  It's not bad in any way that makes it remarkable, it's just not good.\n\n1956 - Double Star by Robert A. Heinlein\n\n* An actor puts on his best performance by impersonating a politician.\n* Worth a read? **Yes**\n* Primary Driver (Plot, World, or **Character**)\n* Bechdel Test? Fail\n* Science Gibberish? Minimal\n* A surprisingly funny and engaging book.  Excellent narrator; charming and charismatic.  Stands the test of time very well.\n\n1958 - The Big Time by Fritz Lieber\n\n* Even soldiers in the time war need safe havens\n* Worth a read? No\n* Primary Driver (Plot, **World**, or Character)\n* Bechdel Test? Pass\n* Science Gibberish? Plenty\n* A rather bland story involving time travel.  Uninteresting characters and dull plot are used to flesh out a none-too-thrilling world.  Saving grace is that it's super short.\n\n1958 - A Case of Conscience by James Blish\n\n* What if alien society seems too perfect?\n* Worth a read? No, but a soft no.\n* Primary Driver (Plot, **World**, or Character)\n* Bechdel Test? Fail\n* Science Gibberish? Plenty\n* Not bad, but not that great.  It's mostly world building, which is half baked.  Also the religion stuff doesn't really do it for me - possibly because the characters are each one character trait, so there's no believable depth to zealotry.\n\n1959 - Starship Troopers by Robert A. Heinlein\n\n* Welcome to the Mobile Infantry, the military of the future!\n* Worth a read? **Yes**\n* Primary Driver (Plot, World, or **Character**)\n* Bechdel Test? Fail\n* Science Gibberish? Minimal\n* Status as classic well earned.  Both a fun space military romp and a condemnation of the military.  No worrisome grey morality.  Compelling protagonist and excellent details keep book moving at remarkable speed.\n\nEdit: Many people have noted that Starship Troopers is purely pro military.  I stand corrected; having seen the movie before reading the book, I read the condemnation into the original text.  There are parts that are anti-bureaucracy (in the military) but those are different.  This does not alter my enjoyment of the book, just figured it was worth noting.\n\n1959 - A Canticle for Leibowitz\n\n* The Order of Leibowitz does its best to make sure that next time will be different.\n* Worth a read? **Yes**\n* Primary Driver (Plot, **World**, or Character)\n* Bechdel Test? Fail\n* Science Gibberish? Minimal\n* I love the first section of this book, greatly enjoy the second, and found the third decent.  That said, if it was only the first third, the point of the book would still be clear.  Characters are very well written and distinct.\n\nNotes:\n\nThese are all Hugo winners, as none of the other prizes were around yet.\n\nI've sorted these by date of publication using this spreadsheet  [https://www.reddit.com/r/printSF/comments/8z1oog/i\\_made\\_a\\_listspreadsheet\\_of\\_all\\_the\\_winners\\_of/](https://www.reddit.com/r/printSF/comments/8z1oog/i_made_a_listspreadsheet_of_all_the_winners_of/)  so a huge thanks to u/velzerat\n\nI'll continue to post each decade of books when they're done, and do a final master list when through everything, but it's around 200 books, so it'll be a hot minute.

I'm trying to keep it concise but informative.\n\nAny questions or comments? Fire away!\n\nEdit!\n\nThe Bechdel Test is a simple question: do two named female characters converse about something other than a man.  Whether or not a book passes is not a condemnation so much as an observation; it was the best binary determination I could find.  Seems like a good way to see how writing has evolved over the years.\n\nFurther Edit!\n\nMany people have noted that science fiction frequently has characters who defy gender - aliens, androids, and so on - looking at you, Left Hand of Darkness!  I'd welcome suggestions for a supplement to the Bechdel Test that helps explore this further.  I'd also appreciate suggestions of anything comparable for other groups or themes (presence of different minority groups, patriarchy, militarism, religion, and so on), as some folks have suggested.  I'll see what I can do, but simplicity is part of the goal here, of course.\n\nEdit on Gibberish!\n\nThis is what I mean:\n\n\"There must be intercommunication between all the Bossies. It was not difficult to found the principles on which this would operate. Bossy functioned already by a harmonic vibration needed to be broadcast on the same principle as the radio wave. No new principle was needed. Any cookbook engineer could do it\u2014even those who believe what they read in the textbooks and consider pure assumption to be proved fact.

So I thought, why not, I love fantasy books and decided I would start from the beginning of the series when I could. Jump to last week, my wife and I head to B&N and pick up a few books. I headed straight to the sci-fi and fantasy section as usual and found the LOTR section. I picked up a copy of the Silmarillion among a few other books and headed out (obviously stopping by the board game selection before leaving).\n\nJump to 3 nights ago, I was sitting in bed reading and my wife was saying she was having a really tough time going to sleep and I said I could read to her. As a note, my wife doesn't prefer the time dedicated to world building that I enjoy, which is basically all of the Silmarillion for as far as I've gotten. So I started reading to her and about a chapter later she was out like a light.\n\nSo for the last couple of nights, our night time procedure has been to get ready for bed then for her to tell me to grab the book and start reading and I've got to say... It is an awesome feeling.  I plan to only read it before bed so I can make this last as long as possible."}, {"subreddit": "travel", "label": 9, "post": "Bel\u00e9m Tower in Lisbon, Portugal "}, {"subreddit": "python", "label": 1, "post": "I made an Ai discord bot for Coronavirus [Predictions , Statistics and over 100 visuals & features] "}, {"subreddit": "technology", "label": 5, "post": "In the office full-time?

EDIT: This needs to be said so I don\u2019t get another pissy comment from some butt-hurt child. It\u2019s okay to like this book. I don\u2019t care. People can like what they like, but let people dislike what they dislike. I\u2019m sure my favorite book is on someone\u2019s shit-list and I think that a-okay. \n\nAlso, you can read [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/miwf6e/my_friend_asked_me_to_read_ready_player_one_and_i/gt74y4h/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3) to see how I actually discussed it with my friend. Too many relationship counselors offering their services for free tonight when their generosity is not actually needed. \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nSo, I\u2019m going to gripe about it here. \n\nFirst off, who is this book even for? It reads like it\u2019s written for middle schoolers, but everything revolves around 80\u2019s references that they wouldn\u2019t understand. I feel like I\u2019m too old to for the book yet I\u2019m a 90\u2019s kid (born late 80\u2019s). \n\nSecond, let me talk more about the terrible writing. Nothing is implied in this book and the reader discovers nothing. Aunt and aunt\u2019s boyfriend = bad people \ud83d\ude41Wade = super clever and righteous \ud83d\ude0a Samantha = sassy and smart \ud83d\ude09 and Sorrento = EVIL! The characters have no nuances whatsoever. The only interesting character development was Aech actually being a chubby black girl, but from I hear about Ready Player Two (more on that later), it just doesn\u2019t go anywhere. Overall, it reads like a book for 13-year-olds, but I just don\u2019t feel like it was intended to be directed at 13-year-olds...?\n\nThird, the \u201clove\u201d story between Wade and Samantha is cheesy, forced, and kind of misogynistic. Like, I thought that he\u2019d realize that he doesn\u2019t actually love her, he\u2019s just crushing really hard. Maybe she\u2019d help him understand that by saying how they haven\u2019t even met and he doesn\u2019t actually know her. To be fair, she tried a little bit, but her main argument was, \u201cyou don\u2019t love me because you don\u2019t know that I\u2019m actually ugly!\u201d What the fuck? The author can tell me that Wade loves her for who she really is and doesn\u2019t care about her looks, but everything always ends up coming back around to her looks anyway. And she falls for him in the end! Why? This relationship makes no goddamn sense. It especially makes no sense because even though she\u2019s way better at the Hunt than he is (sans playing playing a few classic arcade games), Wade still somehow becomes her white knight in shining armor. It\u2019s gross and I hate it, and I\u2019m a dude. Also, I can\u2019t even begin to process how ridiculous a lot of the plot points are, like IOI not being able to beat 4 kids with their team of scholars. Wade even discovers how much info they have on Halliday, and not one person on their team, who have more information than Wade, could figure out the stuff he did?\n\nI\u2019m here to rant and say what I can\u2019t to my friend so I\u2019ll be done now, but I\u2019ll make one comment on Ready Player Two. I just got it from the library, read the prologue and immediately returned it after spending a minute reading about Wade eating fruit.\n\nEdit: Did the kid even give one solitary fuck that his home was blown up and his family murdered? I mean, he almost got killed as well."}, {"subreddit": "python", "label": 1, "post": "I made a script to automatically log into my zoom meetings and record it.

In one was this huge thousand page book with the old cover for the complete and uncut editon (The coolest cover btw). Around this time I had fallen in love with reading and wanted to get my hands on everything. When my I asked my dad if I could read it all he said, \"No, its way to scary.\" For years I always wondered what was so spooky about it. Eveyone I asked said the same thing and even when I got older I was still never allowed to read it. That is untill I got really bored and decided to read it stuck in my appartment during quarintine.\n\n**It really is that spooky -** Books have never scared me, but this one did. Usualy when you think of being scared you think of a jump scare of something like that, this was completely different. It is more like a long spiraling decent of a jump scare. When I was finished reading it I was unsettled for like 2 days. I have never been left with that sort of feeling durring and especially after finishing a book. What makes it worse is the cotent of the book and what is going on today. I could not have picked a better book to read durring this time and I am super glad I did.

A Game Boy emulator written in Python, focused on scripting, AI and learning Back in 2015, it started as a university project. But I\u2019ve kept working on it, and others have started contributing as well over the years. Today we thought it was time to officially release PyBoy v1.0.0 on PyPi and GitHub!\n\n[https://github.com/Baekalfen/PyBoy](https://github.com/Baekalfen/PyBoy)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/g484d4/video/hd2yupa7bst41/player\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/jEpnRRz.gifv](https://i.imgur.com/jEpnRRz.gifv)\n\n## What is PyBoy\n\nIn short, it\u2019s a Game Boy emulator written from scratch in pure Python, with additional support for scripting through an API. We\u2019ve added type definitions, which allows us to compile the software using Cython to get performance comparable to emulators written in C and C++.\n\n## Installation\n\nThe installation instructions are simple: Install SDL2 on your system, and install PyBoy through `pip install pyboy`. If you need to compile from source, we also have detailed instructions on the GitHub Wiki for Mac, Linux and Windows.\n\n[https://github.com/Baekalfen/PyBoy/wiki/Installation](https://github.com/Baekalfen/PyBoy/wiki/Installation)\n\n## Features\n\nPyBoy is designed to be accessible from Python, so we support and encourage people who want to make experiments, bots or AI\u2019s to try it out. We are building game-specific wrappers, which at the moment allows programmers to interface with Tetris and Super Mario Land, without any intricate knowledge of the Game Boy. Documentation can be found at: [https://docs.pyboy.dk](https://docs.pyboy.dk/) .\n\nWe also want to learn and experiment with more exotic features. Based on work from a university project, we\u2019ve added rewinding to the emulator. Which means, you\u2019ll be able to turn back time in any game.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/g484d4/video/zofcwc78bst41/player\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/nr9VWwe.gifv](https://i.imgur.com/nr9VWwe.gifv)\n\n## Feedback, Contribute, Learn\n\nWe\u2019d love to hear your feedback, and see the projects you wish to use PyBoy for! We will do our best to make it happen.\n\nPlease give any feedback in the comments below, on our Discord server or create issues/pull-requests on GitHub if you wish."}, {"subreddit": "gaming", "label": 3, "post": "Who would win?

Contrary to common belief even among the educated, Huxley and Orwell did not prophesy the same thing. Orwell warns that we will be overcome by an externally imposed oppression. But in Huxley's vision, no Big Brother is required to deprive people of their autonomy, maturity and history. As he saw it, people will come to love their oppression, to adore the technologies that undo their capacities to think.\n\nWhat Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one. Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information. Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egoism. Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us. Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance. Orwell feared we would become a captive culture. Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture, preoccupied with some equivalent of the feelies, the orgy porgy, and the centrifugal bumblepuppy. As Huxley remarked in Brave New World Revisited, the civil libertarians and rationalists who are ever on the alert to oppose tyranny \"failed to take into account man's almost infinite appetite for distractions\". In 1984, Huxley added, people are controlled by inflicting pain. In Brave New World, they are controlled by inflicting pleasure. In short, Orwell feared that what we hate will ruin us. Huxley feared that what we love will ruin us.\n\nThis book is about the possibility that Huxley, not Orwell, was right.\n\nGoodreads [link](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/74034.Amusing_Ourselves_to_Death)\n\nedit: Woke up in the middle of the night to my dog jumping on my bed and licking his crotch and saw this post blowing up. Glad to see it resonates with so many beyond myself. I would also like to plug Infinite Jest and DFW's work in general, one of the reasons I found Neil Postman. Infinite Jest is about a Huxley-an dystopian future where advertisers buy the rights to name years, therapy tries to get you to release your inner infant, and a wheelchair-bound group of assassins tries to destabilize the world by disseminating a video that is so entertaining you desire nothing else in life but to watch it.

I kinda messed up not including this in the main post.\n\nBasically I needed to make comparison of a new cloned server vs our old one.\n\nIt has hundreds if not thousand of tables that I'll need to do binary check sums of to ensure that the newly created servers and dbs are completely identical and that the etl procedures are loading the data correctly with the correct data types and values etc.\n\nSo without automation I'll have to do this hundreds if not thousands of times manually:\n\nRun checksum code on old server then run on old server, save the checksum results on an excel worksheet as documentation if they or did not match.\n\nWhat I did is I created a python automation program that gets a list of all tables in a db within a server, then iterates over all those tables and executes the binary check sum query again and again using the tables on a list then saves all the query result on a csv file. \n\nI appended the csv output names with the server name to make them distinct after every run. Then I load that csv to an excel file and then do the final IF comparisons there. \n\nSo instead of doing that manual comparison for hundreds of hours, I was able to do it in 5 hours of coding and now runs for 30 second per database then voila, instant results. \n\nI'm so proud of this not gonna lie."}, {"subreddit": "technology", "label": 5, "post": "AT&T CEO interrupted by a robocall during a live interview "}, {"subreddit": "books", "label": 4, "post": "I hate when the back of a book is devoid of a synopsis and is replaced with critical acclaim Just something that I find quite annoying when looking for a new book, especially when trying to pick up a classic.

Albeit, this is my first time listening to the audio books, which adds a lot more emotion to me, but still. I just finished the chapter where Sirius dies, and I'm crying again. \n\nBut, I'm realizing, I'm crying for a different reason this time. \n\nWhen I was child, I cried for Harry. I cried for the loss he felt, how he'd wished to live with Sirius and have a real family. I was also abused as a child by a step parent and I clung so strongly onto the books of a child that was in a similar situation to me, but could still make friends and practice magic and go on adventures. I was often left in a closet with a flashlight and 1 book of my choice for hours at a time, and I always chose a HP book. \n\nToday, I'm crying for Sirius, and for Remus. I'm crying for the intense isolation they both struggled with after Lily and James died. For the couple short years they got to see each other again. I'm crying for Sirius and how much he struggled to stay in one place, alone in the house where he was abused by his mother. How depressed and lonely he was, and how deeply he wished to have a home to share with Harry. I cried for Sirius, because for one jubilant moment, he felt like he was fighting alongside his best friend again after 15 years. And then, in the same moment, he was gone, falling behind a veil of death. I cried for Remus, who the next moment *needed* to be strong for Harry and to talk some sense into the teenager that would have mindlessly followed into the veil. \n\nI'm still deeply attached to these books and am currently considering how much I have changed as from a girl to a woman, and how this has changed my perspective of these books. The characters I relate to, the situations they're in, etc. \n\nI just wanted to share this small moment of vulnerability with this sub.\n\nEdit: \n\nTo all the folks telling me to read another book, why are you assuming I am not? I only reread these every few years. I'm also reading Dune, and 1984 right now as I'm catching up on things I wasn't exposed to as a kid.

But for me, the journey has not quite ended, and it is real. This trilogy has given me faith in a happy end, however. And I can thank Master Samwise for that. \"It\u2019s like in the great stories Mr. Frodo. The ones that really mattered. Full of darkness and danger they were, and sometimes you didn\u2019t want to know the end. Because how could the end be happy. How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad happened. But in the end, it\u2019s only a passing thing, this shadow. Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer.\""}, {"subreddit": "gaming", "label": 3, "post": "Found a mod for Left for Dead 2 that changes all the graffiti to Jaden Smith tweets "}, {"subreddit": "politics", "label": 7, "post": "Michael Cohen says the associates Trump pardoned may now be forced to testify against him because they can no longer invoke the Fifth Amendment "}, {"subreddit": "science", "label": 2, "post": "Adding cocoa powder to the diet of obese mice resulted in a 21% lower rate of weight gain & less inflammation than the high-fat-fed control mice.

"}, {"subreddit": "python", "label": 1, "post": "I just had a baby, so naturally I had to program a tool for deciphering his schedule *(TLDR at the bottom)*\n\n**THE SITUATION**\n\nMy son came into the world last month and, as first time parents, we've had a hard time handling his hectic feeding schedule. He would burst into screams, and we'd scramble to get a bottle prepared/warmed. However there wasn't a very good way to know how much milk to warm (once you heat it, it has to be either consumed or discarded). And since a bottle takes 5+ minutes to heat up, we'd spend that time fumbling to soothe him until it was ready. After one-to-two weeks of this, I decided to do something about it.\n\nThat's why I created a Python project to take out the guesswork! From the beginning, we were logging all of his feeds because we wanted to make sure he was eating enough (and wasn't eating too much). We use a shared Google Keep note because that's the easiest/quickest way to do it on our phones. And since we'd already gotten into the habit of logging data, I figured 'why not use it to predict when the next bottle will be demanded?'\n\n**WHAT IT DOES**\n\nThe program scrapes all of the content from the Google Keep note and then uses it to estimate the next feed. This estimation includes not only the time, but also the quantity of milk to prepare. It's based on the patterns exhibited over the prior three days, and takes into account both his bottle feeds and his direct breastfeeds. My original goal was to create a legitimate predictive model of his feed patterns, but it quickly became apparent that an explicit model wouldn't be the best strategy (largely due to the irregularity of the feed time data points).\n\nOnce it has crunched the data, the program emails both of us with the outputs. Each email contains two distinct sections: the estimates and the summary. The estimates are the metrics related to the next anticipated bottle (feed time and milk quantity) and they've been pretty accurate so far. The summary includes things like average total daily intake / average feed size / average time between feeds / etc. It's just something I threw in to give us some trending insight, but it's turned out to be immensely helpful -- particularly when answering questions at the pediatrician's office.\n\n**ADMIN/SETUP**\n\nThe program is 100% Python, but it does include some non-standard libraries: gkeepapi and pandas. Unfortunately, Google doesn't support API access for Google Keep (why not??) and we weren't willing to change the way we log data. But luckily [gkeepapi](https://github.com/kiwiz/gkeepapi) exists, and that has proven to work great. The downside is that frequently accessing the Keep note through unofficial means caused Google to regularly prompt me to verify my account activity, which got *very* old *very* quickly. To mitigate that, I added a feature in the program to only check the note when there's likely to be new information there. Since adding that, Google has stopped bugging me about it.\n\nUsing Launchd, I've scheduled the program to run every ten minutes. It can obviously be run manually as well, but it can be run as often as desired. Even if it's run very frequently, it won't access the Keep note or send an email unless there's likely to be new data to consider.\n\nOne goal for this project was that the Google Keep note wouldn't have to change formats from what we'd been doing from the start (we wanted to keep formatting the note lines in the way that was easiest/most intuitive for us). As a result, the format which will allow the program to interpret dates/times/quantities is somewhat rigid. Anyone who uses the program will need to emulate our log style or rewrite the code which extracts data. Another goal for the project was that I'd get some pandas practice in. I admit that pandas was likely overkill for this application, but I wanted to get some experience using it and this project has definitely helped me with the basics.\n\n**NOTES**\n\nThe mins/maxes for the time between feeds and the quantities of milk are based on standards for the baby's age (stored in age\\_info.txt). My son has been fairly consistent/normal with his feeds, so the generally accepted mins/maxes work just fine. But if -- for example -- a baby wanted to eat every hour, the minimum milk quantity per feed would probably be too much.\n\nSince I made this project for my own use and don't really expect other people to use it, there are some hardcoded values. Nothing major -- just people's names for the email, and the note ID for accessing the Google Keep note.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[GitHub repo](https://github.com/tyler-england/forecast-bottle)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR: The program reads a Google Keep note of baby feed data and sends out an email about how/when to prepare the next bottle. It's been very useful. :)**"}, {"subreddit": "gaming", "label": 3, "post": "Respect like that players. "}, {"subreddit": "music", "label": 6, "post": "Spotify will no longer feature R.

Nowadays Python is one of the most popular programming languages. Specialists value its universality for all types of the tasks. Today, one of the most important qualities is convenience of command execution, but often developers have to write a relatively simple program, the quality criterion of which is an intuitive graphical interface. You have several ways to do this by means of Python. The following development tools are among the most popular:\n\n* [PyQt](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/). The widespread Qt library, which implementations are available in various languages. It\u2019s written in C++ and is cross-platform. This library allows the development of applications that have familiar and ordinary appearance in the general sense of this word.\n* [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html)**.** This tool is often referred to as standard for developing GUI applications in Python, appeared back in the early 90s of the twentieth century. Due to the long history and ease of use, Tkinter has a rather extensive and active community. It\u2019s thanks to it you can find a large number of semi-finished products or publications in the network and get an answer to any question at specialized forums.\n* [WxPython](https://wxpython.org)**.** Another descendant of C++, namely WxPython, links the wxWidgets cross-platform library with Python. In some ways, Tkinter and WxPython are quite similar, but WxPython is slightly younger and is more advanced approach to creating GUI applications in Python. Also, the entry barriers for the start are quite low due to the rapidly developing and friendly community.

Thus, the file with MainForm.ui extension is received. To get access in the framework from the project, you need to convert the MainForm.ui file to the \\*.py extension. To do this, go through the command line to the folder containing the file with \\*.ui and run the following command\n\n    pyuic5 -x MainForm.ui -o MainForm.py\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Figure 4 \u2013 File conversion](https://preview.redd.it/az5emddzgxe21.jpg?width=411&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=256f04d8bd8b32b7f697e9f9cf61260eeec995bf)\n\nThus, you get the file of required extension and can run a prototype of the application.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Figure 5 \u2013 Plug-ins of the developed application](https://preview.redd.it/35qvip40hxe21.jpg?width=922&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cdcd1fa72dc01dd2bc79dc2af6d298a9859c341a)\n\nThe full source code has the structure presented at Figure 6. You can find the expanded version on my Github [https://github.com/TinaWard](https://github.com/TinaWard). In this article, I\u2019d like to explain the application\u2019s build in more detail.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Figure 6 \u2013 Application code](https://preview.redd.it/qqkq0331hxe21.jpg?width=889&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ee7b345c93410ffe5fb7fec4a6145874427e788b)\n\n# Step 2. How to convert python script in exe\n\nThe most popular tools for building an application today are [PyInstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org) or [cx\\_Freeze](https://anthony-tuininga.github.io/cx_Freeze/). For this article let\u2019s focus on such building method as cx\\_Freeze. As a matter of fact, it\u2019s analogous to PyInstaller with the only difference that in case of PyInstaller you don\u2019t need to write your own installer script (setup.py), but at the same time, the similar manipulations must be performed via the command line or in the \\* .spec file. The tool cx\\_Freeze is set in the standard way:\n\n    pip install cx_freeze\n    pip install \u2013user cx_freeze\n\nThe first step in creating a full-fledged application is the proper formation of the setup.by file.\n\nThe following is the frame of this file. The steps of the **setup.by** file are intuitive, but let\u2019s look in more detail. First of all, import two entities: the setup function and Executable class. The most informative is the **options** dictionary (dictionary of dictionaries as it's usually called), which is used to improve the build. It may have such parameters:\n\n* **excludes** \u2013 list with description of modules not to be included in the assembly. You shouldn\u2019t overuse this parameter, since you can overdo and delete what you really need: nested dependencies.\n* **includes** \u2013 parameter opposite to excludes, that\u2019s the list of signal modules that must be included in the assembly. Also cx\\_freeze may not find some packages or modules, in particular if they were imported into similar package using the import function. If you have a GUI application, you have to specify the name of the script with the \\*.py extension, in our case it\u2019s **MainForm**.py.\n* **packages** \u2013 compulsory packages to be included.\n* **zip\\_include\\_packages** \u2013 list of packages to be archived\n* **include\\_files** \u2013 list of lines or files tuples that need to be added to the assembly, but these are not Python files.\n\nNow let's take a closer look at the Executable class:\n\n* **targetName** allows you to specify the name of the \\*.exe file, by default it matches the name of the launching script.\n* **base** = **\u2018Win32GUI\u2019** If you set a parameter as described in the example, it means that the graphical application is processing and the console window will not appear.\n* **icon** \u2013 parameter to set the icon of the application launcher, by default uses pictures with \\*.ico ext.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n    # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n    \n    from cx_Freeze import setup, Executable\n    import os\n    options = {\n    'build.exe': { 'icludes': ['MainForm'], 'packages': ['pandas'], 'excludes ': excludes } }\n    os.environ['TCL_LIBRARY'] = r'C:\\Users\\User3\\Anaconda3\\tcl\\tcl8.6'\n    os.environ['TK_LIBRARY'] = r'C:\\Users\\User3\\Anaconda3\\tcl\\tk8.6'\n    setup(\n    name = \"TextTool\", version = \"0.0\", description = \"Here write smth\", options = options, executables = [Executable('TextToolS.py', targetName = \u2018ThisIsName.exe\u2019)])\n\nTo compile you need to run the setup.py file. To do this, enter the following code via the command line from the project directory:\n\n    python setup.py build\n\nAfter that you will see the launch of the project build.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Figure 7 \u2013 Running project build](https://preview.redd.it/jgtrlj6khxe21.jpg?width=655&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=480540ce993a8208c81fce78d18c3413149f8f9b)\n\nBuilding a project can take from 10 seconds to several minutes, depending on the size and number of interconnected modules in your application.\n\nNot always the project build runs smoothly, let\u2019s look at some of the most common mistakes. Most of them can be solved by searching and writing in the correct parameters of the setup function in the setup.py file, but often due to laziness or lack of time, the temporary ways are implemented to solve this problem. For example, this one, when you haven\u2019t specified the module\u2019s addition:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Figure 8 \u2013 Error example](https://preview.redd.it/dx9fl0glhxe21.jpg?width=873&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3955eff4159f0fdff1a670fe7d664e05f11a5cce)\n\n    \"Missing required dependencies {0}\".format(missing_dependencies))\n    ImportError: Missing required dependencies ['numpy']\n\nTo make this just copy \\_methods.py file from Anaconda library\n\n\u2026\\\\Anaconda3\\\\Lib\\\\site-packages\\\\numpy\\\\core\n\nto numpy folder \u2018core\u2019, located\n\n\u2026\\\\build\\\\exe.win-amd64-3.6\\\\lib\\\\numpy\\\\core.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Figure 9 \u2013 First type error fix](https://preview.redd.it/jd0b7ufnhxe21.jpg?width=794&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3f7e9f296b4f18d85b7466810e16af8af6527de6)\n\nThe second common mistake is undersampling hidden dependencies. It\u2019s possible that you didn\u2019t see the hidden dependencies of the packages and didn\u2019t add it. Often the problem occurs with packages like idnadata\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Figure 10 \u2013 Second type error](https://preview.redd.it/46jgu19ohxe21.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e60341d7b67b77cad604b95cbcfb313ddc1edd69)\n\n    File \"C:\\Users\\User3\\Anaconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\tldextract\\__init__.py\", line 3, in <module>\n    from .cli import __version__\n    File \"C:\\Users\\User3\\Anaconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\tldextract\\cli.py\", line 14, in <module>\n    from .tldextract import TLDExtract\n    File \"C:\\Users\\User3\\Anaconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\tldextract\\tldextract.py\", line 62, in <module>\n    import idna\n    File \"C:\\Users\\User3\\Anaconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\idna\\__init__.py\", line 2, in <module>\n    from .core import *\n    File \"C:\\Users\\User3\\Anaconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\idna\\core.py\", line 1, in <module>\n    from . import idnadata\n    ImportError: cannot import name 'idnadata'\n\nThe algorithm is the same, you find the missing file in the folders of the installed libraries and copy it in the appropriate folder of your assembly. This\u2019s win-win option if you need a quick compilation for testing.\n\nFrom \u2026\\\\Anaconda3\\\\Lib\\\\site-packages\\\\idna to \u2026\\\\build\\\\exe.win-amd64-3.6\\\\lib\\\\idna\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Figure 11 \u2013Second type error fix](https://preview.redd.it/exn2z8tphxe21.jpg?width=692&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2963ac8ae8552f8295d824068ad19c9d7578c062)\n\nIn general, the advantages of cx\\_Freeze are:\n\n* Startup files for Linux\n* MSI installers for Windows\n* RPM packages for Linux\n* Software packages for Mac OS X (.app, .dmg)\n\nThe disadvantages are:\n\n* No possibility to pack all python-modules and dll-files in one exe-file\n* No cross compilation\n\n# Conclusion\n\nIn this article we have looked at the principles of creating a GUI application in Python using PyQt and compiling the created app to \\*.exe by means of cx\\_Freeze.

I loved them to the point that one of my \u201csaddest\u201d moments as a child was my mom breaking a promise to take me to the library. We went the next day, but as a kid who had nothing to judge it against, it was rough. Eventually I began growing up and like many people my library usage dwindled. I still had positive feelings towards them, but it wasn\u2019t convenient for me or I was distracted by other things. I just stopped having a need for it. Since I stopped going to the library, my reading dwindled. While my family got the Harry Potter books as they came out, I didn\u2019t do much reading beyond that and required reading for school. \n\nFast forward to 16 years old and me moving from California to Canada, and I was nearly cut off from reading completely, that is until I learned my school had a library, and I began reading at a pace I had never done before. I read 31 books in 3 months, a couple I had read before but most were new. My school had AR reading Points, and while we were required to get 25 points, I got 469. However girlfriends, videogames, and reddit took me away from reading. I read very little after that for a few years. Until I learned of Overdrive (now Libby), which allowed me to download books from my local Library straight to my phone. Again my reading use climbed. I think at this point I should mention that while I grew up middle class, by this point I was firmly poor, as I continue to be today. \n\nAt the end of High school I had a crazy idea. I decided to walk across the US. 4,500 miles of walking over the course of roughly a year. I spent anywhere from 8-16 hours a day walking and would often go a few days without talking to people. My journey was about more than travel it was about self-improvement and experiencing things I\u2019d never gotten to before. To that end I would download audiobooks and I listened to many of the classics I had never read before. It made many days pass by quicker and helped me retain my sanity. I would have never been able to afford those audiobooks myself. When I finished my trip, I had crossed 18 states, worn out 8 pairs of shoes, and listened to/read over 40 books from The Count of Monte Cristo to His Dark Materials, to the Art of War. \n\nWhen I returned home I began to follow my local library and would occasionally see new programs it would have in the news. A couple years ago they got 3D printers and so, redditor that I am, printed off a Snoo to bring to meetups. While I was there, there was about an 8 year old girl who was 3D printing some little plastic keychain tags for her friends. I was amazed that she even knew how to do that. Then earlier this year they started loaning out GoPro Kits and so on Labour Day, a friend and I hitchhiked up north a bit to go camping and made a video of the trip. As someone who is low income, the Library has helped me to do things I would never have been able to do, and in some cases, never would have thought to do. My library has also put a recording studio in one of the branches and has many other programs such as a podcast listening club (book club but for podcasts), they allow you to digitize old photos, move VHS and CD\u2019s to digital files, give help on research, allow you to read magazines and newspapers from around the world (literally as the stuff is published), borrow museum/regional park passes, and so much more. While I had thought that being able to download ebooks/audiobooks to my phone would mean I\u2019d never have to go to the library again, all of the other offerings my library has makes me keep going back. My life has had many periods of off-and-on again library usage, and it may continue, but I know that when I need it, it will be there for me. \n\nI would like to say thank you to all the librarians (and library technicians!) that have helped me. Some have helped me find books, some have kept the library organized, some have gotten added books I recommended to the collection, and some have ensured the Library continues to grow, evolve, and keep bringing me back. I can say with certainty that my life would be genuinely worse without the Library. Keep up the good work and I\u2019ll see you tomorrow when I have to return The Marrow Thieves. \n"}, {"subreddit": "python", "label": 1, "post": "Thought this looked familiar...

She had been on home hospice for only a week. My heart is broken, but she is at peace, and not in pain. I don't need or request or expect any comments. I only needed to close this door and look forward. I've already sent Scott at Crush Music a note of appreciation for what he and Billie Joe Armstrong did for Karen. I guess no photos are allowed on the music page, but if anyone wants to see how beautiful she was, I'm going to post a photo of her with my old bike on the Harley page.

Three days ago, she was diagnosed with stomach cancer that has spread to her spine and elsewhere. Karen probably has little time. She is the biggest GREEN DAY fan on earth, and would trade me for Billie Joe Armstrong in a heartbeat!\n\nMy heart is breaking because I can do so little for her. I can only visit her for 4 hours a day, so the rest of the time I'm lost. Is there anyone here that can show me a path to contacting the manager for Billie Joe Armstrong/Green Day? If Karen could just get a card or a kind word from Billie Joe, I know her heart would melt.\n\nI'm trying one of those \"contact a celebrity\" websites, but frankly I have little confidence in such a commercial venture. I have much more in all of you.\n\nDesperate for help. Thank you!\n\n.............................................................................NEW..............................................................................\n\nI'm going to repost our happy ending just to make sure you wonderful caring redditors see it again.

Thanks again all!\n\n(from last night)\n\nOMG all of you! **IT WORKED!!!**! I just got home from visiting Karen. Earlier this afternoon I took a suggestion from one of you to contact Crush Music which has a Green Day connection. An email to their general info mailbox was soon answered by Scott Nagelberg. I opened the email in the hospital room to find that it INCLUDED A SWEET, HEARTFELT VIDEO MESSAGE TO KAREN FROM **BILLIE JOE ARMSTRONG!!!**\n\nWe both ugly cried right there (this time for a GOOD reason). She just kept repeating until I had to leave \"That's the sweetest thing anyone has ever done for me!\"\n\nI haven't had time to acknowledge everyone's comments, but I will. You have proven once again that the power of regular, caring people is undefeatable! Thank you all, and especially to **BILLIE JOE, SCOTT NAGELBERG, AND CRUSH MUSIC!** Y'all are awesome!\n\nBTW, for the very few haters and doubters, I did Identify both Karen and myself to Crush Music, and included contact information.\n\n......................................Update February 11th ......................................................\n\nYou've all been so kind, and many have asked for updates. Today Karen had her second round of radiation, and her first infusion of chemo. We are hoping she can come home this weekend. Thank you all again.\n\n..................................Update February 16th...............................................................\n\nKaren gets to come home after radiation today! still more of that and chemo for the foreseeable future, but it's a great step. Thank you all for your concerns.\n\n...................................Update 2-27-21..........................................................\n\nSince I'm still getting comments (thank you) I should update. Karen is home and completed radiation last Tuesday. She was supposed to have her chemo, but the medication did not arrive, so it's delayed until Monday. We are most concerned that she is unable to eat or drink virtually anything without nausea, and her weight is down to 98lbs. Her pain is manageable,  and she walks across the room with her walker. We do appreciate your continued concern.\n\n3-31-21\n\nI haven't updated in awhile, and I'm not sure if anyone is interested. Karen is still with me. She was back in the hospital last week due mainly to dehydration and lack of nutrition. (She still can't eat or drink without throwing up. I honestly don't know what's keeping her going.) She decided it was due to the chemo, so she refused to go for her infusion that was due last Monday.\n\nShe came home on Saturday, but refused home health visits. I heard her throwing up last night at 3 but she's sleeping now. Her sisters are supposed to come the last week of April, and her 2 kids and 2 grandchildren the week after that. Some part of me is afraid that she is just holding on for that. Another trip to the ER this week won't surprise me. They talked last week about doing another endoscopy, but she wanted OUT!

Here are my side-by-side thoughts: **Brief Background**: My brother introduced me to the movies at 11. In the past 18 years I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve seen them all. My best friend used to have LOTR Sundays during college and play them in the background while we studied (she could always maintain studying, I never did). I\u2019ve seen these movies an absurd amount of times.\n\n**My Comparative Thoughts**\n\n- Tolkien\u2019s a true storyteller. So much so that he makes his characters natural storytellers, too. This at times fell a bit flat when characters told their experiences to other characters instead of us seeing them live. It felt very against the \u201cshow don\u2019t tell rule\u201d of good writing. It made me appreciate how the movie captured those scenes fully. But honestly, by the end I really found appreciation for this stylistic choice.\n- With the movies, I tend to prefer the Aragorn/Legolas/Gimli scenes, but in the books I found a lot more interest in the Frodo and Sam parts. Book 4 just may be my favorite overall. Definitely the one I read the fastest. **Edit**: Lord of the Rings is technically three volumes (FotR, TT, RotK) separated into 6 books, 2 books per volume. So the 4th book of LOTR solely focuses on Frodo, Sam, and Gollum\u2019s travels up to Shelob.\n- A bit specific, but Denethor\u2019s death is **significantly better** than in the movies. The movie version seems so hokey now whereas the book truly captured his devolving to madness. Don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever watch it the same. **Edit to specify**: Denethor\u2019s running through Minas Tirith on fire vs him clinging to the palant\u00edr on the pyre is what makes it pretty cheesy for me. The latter is chilling and a better way to close his character\u2019s arc.\n- Last night I was prepared for the last 80 pages to drag, but I flew through them. There have been many times watching the trilogy where I\u2019ll opt out after Aragorn\u2019s crowning ceremony because it\u2019s just a slow fizzle out, but the wrapping up in the book was so pleasant, intriguing, attentive and gave me the best sense of closure. I was gushing by the time I closed the book because I sincerely loved the way Tolkien brought the fellowship\u2019s story to a close. \n- **Edit** because I keep getting screamed at about it: Tom Bombadil is certainly a cool character. He\u2019s whimsical, thoughtful, truly loves his wife (aw), got songs4days, and he\u2019s subtly (to be read in an Always Sunny Mac voice) *badass*. To be the only character (even including Sam) to casually throw on the ring and be like \u201cOh this ol\u2019 thing?\u201d and throw it back to Frodo is fuckin cool, man. **But** I really have no problem with him not being in the movies. If they threw him in for 5 minutes pre-Bree it wouldn\u2019t have been justified enough. If they gave him a proper 15-20 minute scene, it would\u2019ve taken the *Fellowship* overboard.

What I'm doing and why I'm doing it So, here's what I'm doing and why I'm doing it.\n\nI've been a high school Computer Science teacher for over 10 years (like 11ish but who's counting at this point...)\n\nI have always taught kids in my room but I started teaching an AP Computer Science course in java virtually two years ago. This was all fine and good but I got interested in providing my own a-synchronous resources for my students to make learning virtually more accessible. Fast forward a year and we've convinced my district that if I can make video series for students to learn introduction programming then it will help non-trained teachers offer these courses to students at smaller rural schools where there are less course offerings.\n\nThat triggered me getting to produce my Arduino course. Then this year, expedited by the pandemic and the need for virtual resources, I got to build my Python course. Next up is building a full Java course that hits on everything in the AP Computer Science A curriculum.\n\nI know there's a million resources out there and I was doing it for my district and my students, but I figured if I'm going to be doing it anyway, I might as well share it with a broader audience. So, with permission, I \"branded\" the content and published it all on YouTube.\n\nAnyway, from one CS teacher to a bunch of humans trying to learn how to code: I hope it's helpful.\n\nLink to YT Channel: [https://www.youtube.com/c/CodeWithConner](https://www.youtube.com/c/CodeWithConner)\n\nLink to my site: [https://www.codewithconner.ca/](https://www.codewithconner.ca/)\n\nHappy Tuesday, may your BTC/GME go to the moon (if that's your thing) :)"}, {"subreddit": "travel", "label": 9, "post": "Porto, Portugal.

I hadn't heard any of her concepts or stories discussed in popular culture much though, no references or anything. Even though I hadn't seen Pulp Fiction until a week ago, I still knew the basic premise of the film and several of the scenes were familiar to me. They're talked about a lot, people make jokes and references to it and other films. But Ursula LeGuin was someone I'd only ever heard mentioned when the topic of \"good science fiction authors\" came up. I was more into realistic fiction and historical dramas, so that didn't really grab me all that much.\n\nA few months ago though, I saw her name on the spine of a book in the shop, and pulled it out. It was The Left Hand of Darkness, and the preview text on the back so intrigued me I decided to take a break from my usual fare and try it out. I breezed through that book, it was so dense and intriguing, but it never left you lost. There were so many ideas in it to think about, I found it remained on my mind for weeks after completing it. The concept of a world and society without gender and such malleable sexuality was unlike anything I'd ever read before. Still the same hierarchies and political squabbles, but none of it was gendered. I especially like the use of the word 'pervert' to describe individuals whose genitals do not change, its use made perfect sense given the context.\n\nThat's what I loved so much about the story, it was *believable*. It wasn't trying to amaze you with futuristic tech and complex theorizing the way science fiction tends to be portrayed in the media. It was a delve into how people lived their lives, in a world quite similar to ours but with a few major differences.\n\nSpoilers for The Left Hand of Darkness (highly suggest you read before clicking) >!I especially find it interesting how Genly Ai cannot fully understand Estraven as a person without gender, until they must traverse the Gobrin Ice. Ai goes back and forth between seeing Estraven as a man and as a woman, depending on the situation. Even on the Ice, the same action is deemed both masculine and feminine at different points in Ai's thinking. Cooking a meal and caring for Ai's injuries is either a practical, masculine thing to do as a friend and travel companion, and it is seen as a diminutive and contemptible feminine action the way a woman may care for her husband. This is more towards the moment when Ai finally understands Estraven in the whole, when he realizes how truly little difference there is between what we consider to be masculine or feminine, how it is merely a matter of perspective. I find it interesting how in order to understand Estraven's gender fully, it took a trip across the the Gobrin Ice, a complete separation from society. Gender seemingly only relevant there.!<\n\nNow I've been reading The Dispossessed, and it is equally well written. There's a scene where our main character, Shevek, enters a garden. He sees the trees there, trees and grass from an alien world. It's strange to him, and seeking out comfort he sits down on a bench, next to a woman reading a book. LeGuin writes here of Shevek's need if companionship, which is the main driving force behind him sitting down next to the woman. He recognizes her, he knows her well. He knows she has never been to this planet. It's only after three paragraphs or so when you learn this is not a flesh and blood person, it is a statue of a famous historical figure. But LeGuin writes it this way so you feel the same companionship Shevek does, you feel the presence of a fellow soul, only once you have settled into this idea are they revealed to be a statue, and Shevek's loneliness becomes all the more apparent.\n\nLeGuin writes beautifully, but her works delve deep into complex ideas that leave your brain grappling with them long after your eyes leave the last page. But I rarely hear people talk about LeGuin outside of science fiction book circles. No references in pop culture, no praise or attention except from those who are already into novels of this genre. Im disappointed I didn't know more about her sooner. I'd recommend her as someone to read if you want an introduction to what science fiction can really accomplish.\n\n**Edit:** Many people have been mischaracterizing my post as though I believe LeGuin to be some lost, forgotten author, unrecognized by history. That's not what I think, I know she's received heaps of praise and awards in the literary circle. But that's by and large where it ends. I never see references to her work in popular culture, online, in other pieces of media, etc. She has received plenty of attention from readers, and rightfully so, but she seems to have received very little of it outside this field."}, {"subreddit": "science", "label": 2, "post": "Water found in a habitable super-Earth's atmosphere for the first time.

Hi, everyone.\n\nDuring Covid break, I wanted some new hobby. So I started to read but I was less interested in ebooks. So at the end of May (on my 31st birthday) I purchased few books & started a reading challenge in goodreads. Today I completed the challenge.\n\n[Books I've Read:](https://i.imgur.com/VMVoMPA.png)\n\n* I started with **The Godfather** bcoz it was my favorite movie, It was beautifully written by Mario Puzo, I only read it before bed & finished it in 6 days. Really wanted more sequels.\n* Next, it was Classic Sci-Fi **Dune**, I'm a big fan of Sci-Fi everyone recommended Dune, it started of bit slowly & then I was blown over, what a great story, A Jihad in Space! (I will reread it later before the sequels)\n* **1984**: I had already watched the movie but reading the novel made me depressed, I never enjoyed it.\n* **The Martian**: I've watched the movie, but Novel was better than the movie & never had a dull moment, I would probably read it again.\n* **The Girl with a Dragon Tattoo**: I've watched the Millennium Trilogy, Extended Mini TV series, American remake, still the novel was good, one of the best thriller.\n* **The Hobbits**: I've watched the Trilogy, the studio had milked it for greed & ruined the whole story with unnecessary love interest & I liked the novel it was better.\n* **The Lord of Rings**: The Classic Fantasy, Tolkien is the god of Fantasy novels, there are no words to explain it.\n* **Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind** is a ambitious book by Yuval Noah Harari, I had never read an non-fiction or historic book, but after reading this book I want to explore them.\n   * I read Homo Deus, but it was OK but not ground breaking like Sapiens.\n* **Stories of your Life and Others**: **Ted Chiang** is a Genius, I had already read the Stories of your Life short story epub after watching The Arrival it was great. Tower of Babylon, Seventy-Two Letters were also great & Understand was my favorite.\n   * I've read **Exhalation: Stories** also, I really can't stop praising Ted Chiang, particularly The Merchant and the Alchemist's Gate was so good, I want more, probably a full fledged novel in that universe. Even Exhalation & Anxiety is the Dizziness of Freedom were great stories.\n* **I, Robot**: A classic novel with lot of good short stories. I really like Issac Asimov's robot universe, so I had ordered rest of the books from Robot & Foundation Series.\n   * I've read **Caves of Steel**, **Naked Sun** & **Robots of Dawn**, they are lit bit slow but worth it, I liked the ending of Robots of Dawn finished it today.\n* **2001: A Space Odyssey**: A great novel, probably the best Sci-Fi novel & movie, when i first watched the movie, I knew Kubrick was a Maverick Genius, probably one of the greatest minds in movie industry. Finally after reading the novel, now I can say that I understand 2001: A Space Odyssey. I'll reread it again before the sequels.\n* **Station Eleven**: A Post-Apocalyptic novel by Emily St. John Mandel, I was probably bit disappointing with the ending, I was waiting for a final standoff or something, even though I had guessed who The Prophet was, still a good novel. My favorite thing was how the story-lines were connected to Arthur.\n* **The Road**: A Post-Apocalyptic masterpiece by Cormac McCarthy. It is one of saddest, most bleakest novel, I had watched the movie but reading the novel gave me chills!\n   * Cormac McCarthy writing is beautiful, this paragraph briefly explains the state of post-apocalyptic world:\n\n>At the farther edge of the town they came upon a solitary house in field and they crossed end entered and walked through the rooms. They came upon themselves in a mirror and he almost raised the pistol. It's us, Papa, the boy whispered. It's us.\n\nI have watched lot of movies & tv series but nowadays I'm bit bored, the quality of stories have dwindled, now its quantity comes first compared to quality, there are 100 of TV shows every year & movies are ruined by sequels, prequels, remakes & reboots.\n\nSo reading books have given me a joy, something to look forward when i reach home apart from watching Football.\n\nAfter following these subreddits: r/books, r/booksuggestions, r/printSF \\- I've added lot of books to my read-list & spent a lot on books, have many in my cupboard, now i need to spend on a bookshelf.\n\nIf you have any recommendation, please tell me.\nSorry if my English is bad.\nThank you.\n\n**Edit: Thank you for your kind replies, I'll try to reply to everyone.**\n\nAnd I've heard lot of good things about Brandon Sanderson, most of you recommended it. I'll start Cosmere Universe (I've been collecting them already) but first I've to read Foundation Series, later I'll start Cosmere Universe.\n\n**Edit: I can't believe so many of you replied & suggested lot of great books, thank you very much.**\n\nFinally I've 561 books in to-read-list, and I own 52 book now, so my next goal for 2021 will be 40 Books.\n\nAgain, Thank you!"}, {"subreddit": "sports", "label": 8, "post": "How to celebrate a goal in style "}, {"subreddit": "python", "label": 1, "post": "Python + Quantum Research = Art + Saving 1000s hours of CPU time "}, {"subreddit": "technology", "label": 5, "post": "Vinyl record sales surpass CDs for the first time since the 1980s "}, {"subreddit": "sports", "label": 8, "post": "My school has an app that syncs your phone flashlight with our light show.

I see this a lot in young adult novels and I can understand the reasoning behind this theme - young adults learning to grow and learn more about themselves and realise that they are different than what they might appear, and/or perceive themselves as different from their peers.\n\nThen they realise that they are different or unique in some way and fear that this makes them feel ostracised or unable to fit in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEven I experienced this when I was young and I still struggle with this and I am sure that many people still struggle to find acceptance amongst others or amongst themselves, whether child or adult.\n\nHowever, in reality, I feel that this is also damaging and quite cliche that it makes the whole idea of change and embracing uniqueness meaningless.\n\nI get that this trope is meant to make the reader feel empowered and embrace and become wowed by the world that is around them but I feel that sometimes comes across as shallow or not geniune or authentic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI like this idea of embracing uniqueness in some way because even I struggle to accept myself as who I am, warts and all.\n\nI do not consider myself to be different from others or the outcast but I do have qualities that makes me unique or identifiable from those around me.\n\nAnd even when I was growing up, I realised this even though I also had trouble to understand it or embrace it.\n\nBut as I grew older, as much as I have learned to embrace my individuality, I realised that these individual traits do not make me special or incredibly unique.\n\nYes, I know that many parts of human society provoke me and everyone else to follow the status quo because of peer pressure or follow some form of group think or taboo and every one of us experiences this in some shape or form.\n\nBut in many aspects, these are things that make me human and the things that make us want to fit in.\n\nAnd ironically, once you fit in with someone else who also identify as \"different\" or \"unique\", you realise that you are not so unique or different after all - you are just a mixture of many traits just like everyone else and you might fit in or become accepted in mulitple different groups.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYes, there are things in human psychology and/or human society that are either unhealthy or need to be updated but it is not that simple as flipping a switch and make a change. In reality, either these things have a purpose or are so integrated in how human beings function that it is difficult to replace them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think that most of these subliminal messages about change, revolution, individuality and noticing the stuff that is happening underneath are either empty messages, or are not as impactful as they are meant to be, or are mostly empty marketing to exploit people's insecurities or desires to make an impact.\n\nIf you do not give people the right message about the positives and also the consequences, repurucssions and complications about change, uniqueness and revolution, then you are giving an ironic message about the whole idea behind the message and it is basically the same message as everything else - a message of little substance that has a lot of things happening underneath that are meant to provoke a certain group of people to behave in a certain expected way\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is not a means to attack any kind of movement or an advocacy to represent change.

I'm Al Sweigart (rhymes with \"why dirt\"), author of \"Automate the Boring Stuff with Python\" and several other programming books. I release all of my books under a Creative Commons license, so you can read them for free on my website at https://inventwithpython.com\n\nMy latest books are [The Big Book of Small Python Projects](https://inventwithpython.com/bigbookpython/) and [Beyond the Basic Stuff with Python](https://inventwithpython.com/beyond/). I'm currently working on a book about recursion (the recursion jokes get funnier every time I hear them) which should be available in 2022. The ideas for this book grew into [a 2018 North Bay Python talk I gave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfBqVVKg4GE).\n\n\"Big Book\" contains the source code for 81 games, puzzles, simulations, and animations that were designed to be short and simple to understand. Folks tend to get caught up in repeating yet another \"hello world\" tutorial, but don't quite know how to apply the programming concepts they learned into actual programs. This book is full of source code that they can study to see how real-world programs work. They aren't just code snippets but actual, runnable programs. If you've been told you should \"work on your projects\" but don't know where to start, or if you've been told \"look at the source code of open source projects\" but found them undocumented and inscrutable, check out these programs.\n\n\"Beyond the Basic Stuff\" is a sort of follow up to \"Automate the Boring Stuff\" (or any other beginner Python resource). It goes into how professionals write code and best practices they follow. There's information on how to find help on your own, how to format your code and name your variables, an explanation of common programming jargon, the basics of Git, three chapters on object-oriented programming (and more importantly, when and why to use OOP), and more.\n\nYou've probably seen [my posts at the start of the month](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/obq0cg/automate_the_boring_stuff_with_python_online/) when I make my online Python course free. About 15,000 to 30,000 people sign up each month, though according to my stats only about 5% of people actually complete the course (which is typical for online courses, free or paid).\n\nI got started writing programming books in 2009 when my then-girlfriend was a nanny for kid who wanted to learn to program. I started writing a book (which would become Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python) and self-published. People liked it, so I kept writing, and Automate was my first book through a traditional publisher, No Starch Press. I quit my software developer job in 2013 to finish writing Automate, thinking I'd get another software dev job in a year. But I kept having more ideas for other books, tutorials, videos, etc. so I'm still here writing.\n\nAsk me anything! Post your questions and upvote questions you find interesting, and at 2pm central I'll begin replying.\n\nEDIT (4:30pm Central) Wow, I've been typing nonstop for two and a half hours. I'm going to take a quick break and then keep going. Thanks for the questions, everyone!\n\nEDIT 2: Oh yeah, I forgot to mention I'm also creating a 56-video Udemy course for the Beyond the Basic Stuff with Python book as well.

OMB told GAO that it withheld the funds to ensure that they were not spent \"in a manner that could conflict with the President\u2019s foreign policy.\" The law does not permit OMB to withhold funds for policy reasons. \n\n* [The full decision can be found here.](<https://www.gao.gov/products/B-331564>) \n\n* [The full report is available here](<https://www.gao.gov/assets/710/703909.pdf>).\n\n---\n\n##Submissions that may interest you\n\nSUBMISSION | DOMAIN\n---|----\n[Watchdog: White House violated law in freezing Ukraine aid](https://apnews.com/9127109f325778490fd40c5f98be1817) | apnews.com\n[Watchdog: White House violated law in freezing Ukraine aid](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/jan/16/watchdog-white-house-violated-law-in-freezing-ukra/) | washingtontimes.com\n[GAO concludes Trump administration broke law by withholding Ukraine aid](https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/16/politics/gao-report-administration-violated-law-withholding-aid/index.html) | cnn.com\n[Federal watchdog finds OMB violated law by withholding Ukraine aid](https://www.axios.com/gao-decision-omb-trump-ukraine-aid-2aab62ea-2e50-4301-bae7-afa5a88282ee.html) | axios.com\n[GAO finds Trump administration broke law by withholding aid from Ukraine](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/478557-gao-finds-trump-administration-broke-law-by-withholding-aid-from) | thehill.com\n[White House violated the law by freezing Ukraine aid, GAO says](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/01/16/white-house-violated-the-law-by-freezing-ukraine-aid-gao-says-099682) | politico.com\n[Press statement regarding GAO Decision B-331564, Office of Management and Budget--Withholding of Ukraine Security Assistance](https://www.gao.gov/about/press-center/press-releases/press-statement-b-331564-omb-ukraine.htm) | gao.gov\n[Trump administration broke law in withholding Ukraine aid \u2018for a policy reason,\u2019 watchdog says](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/16/trump-administration-broke-law-in-withholding-ukraine-aid.html) | cnbc.com\n[Office of Management and Budget\u2014Withholding of Ukraine Security Assistance](https://www.gao.gov/assets/710/703909.pdf) | gao.gov\n[Trump administration violated the law by withholding Ukraine security aid, Government Accountability Office finds](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2020/01/16/trump-administration-violated-the-law-by-withholding-ukraine-security-aid-government-accountability-office-finds/) | washingtonpost.com\n[Trump Broke The Law In Freezing Ukraine Funds, Watchdog Report Concludes](https://www.npr.org/2020/01/16/796806517/trump-broke-the-law-in-freezing-ukraine-funds-watchdog-report-concludes) | npr.org\n[White House Broke Law in Aid Delay, GAO Says: Impeachment Update](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-16/senators-to-be-sworn-in-by-chief-justice-impeachment-update) | bloomberg.com\n[Trump administration violated the law by withholding Ukraine aid, Government Accountability Office says](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/ukraine-aid-hold-violated-law-government-accountability-office-n1117031?cid=sm_npd_nn_tw_ma) | nbcnews.com\n[White House hold on Ukraine aid violated federal law, congressional watchdog says](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/white-house-hold-on-ukraine-aid-violated-federal-law-congressional-watchdog-says/2020/01/16/060ea7aa-37a3-11ea-9c01-d674772db96b_story.html) | washingtonpost.com\n[Government Accountability Office Finds That Trump White House Illegally Held Up Ukraine Aid](https://www.thedailybeast.com/government-accountability-office-finds-that-trump-white-house-illegally-held-up-ukraine-aid?source=articles&via=rss) | thedailybeast.com\n[Gov\u2019t Watchdog Office: OMB Broke Law With Trump-Ordered Ukraine Aid Freeze](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/government-accountability-office-trump-omb-ukraine-freeze) | talkingpointsmemo.com\n[Watchdog Says Trump Administration Broke Law in Withholding Ukraine Aid](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/16/us/politics/gao-trump-ukraine.html) | nytimes.com\n[White House Broke the Law in Ukraine Aid Delay, GAO Says: Impeachment Update](https://www.yahoo.com/news/senators-sworn-chief-justice-impeachment-110000536.html) | yahoo.com\n[Read the full watchdog report on Ukraine aid withholding](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/read-the-full-watchdog-report-on-ukraine-aid-withholding) | pbs.org\n[Trump violated law by withholding Ukraine aid: Government watchdog](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-violated-law-withholding-ukraine-aid-government-watchdog/story?id=68327172) | abcnews.go.com\n[Senate Urged to Convict Trump After GAO Says White House Broke Law by Freezing Ukraine Aid](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2020/01/16/senate-urged-convict-trump-after-gao-says-white-house-broke-law-freezing-ukraine-aid) | commondreams.org\n[The GAO just said Trump broke the law.

Over the better part of the past decade I've collected names of books and notable lists of best Sci-Fi and have been slowly increasing the number of books I've read that are considered the best of my favourite genre. It's been great and I have no intention of stopping!\n\nAbout 2-3 years ago I decided to take on [Reddit's most recommended Sci-Fi](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/wiki/fiction#wiki_science-fiction). There were several books that I'd already read, and a bunch I'd never even heard of, and since I'm a Redditor, and the list overlaps with a lot of other lists that I mentioned above, I decided I'd go for completion. Ultimately It's a partial completion, since some of the recommendations are for a full series and there are some that I only read Book 1 rather than the whole series, but with that one caveat, as of the other day, when I made it to the last page of *The Book of Ler*, I have officially completed the list!\n\nI just wanted to mark the occasion by sharing some thoughts, joys, and disappointments with everyone here:\n\n**A Fire Upon the Deep** Is an absolute stand out. I had no idea what to expect. I'd never heard of Vernor Vinge so it's one of those books that when I'd see it on a list, it just never stuck out for me. Basically, it blew my mind. It's rare to come across the perfect triple threat of world-building, plot, and characters but I don't think I'd be over-stating it if I said this one got high marks on all three. It is now one of my favorite books.\n\n**Book of the New Sun** inspires ambivalent feelings. I read *Shadow & Claw* which is actually 2 of 4 books in the series. If I'd stopped after the first book, I'd probably have just written it off as not my thing/overrated and moved on, but I finished the second, and while it never fully drew me, by the end I was interested in finding out more about what was going on. I might read the rest of the series, but it holds a weird place for me where I have interest without enjoyment.\n\n**Cloud Atlas** is a great example of interesting writing. I'm probably not alone in having difficulty staying immersed with the frequent change in setting, but I can say that once I got through the first half, I couldn't put it down. \n\n**The Mote in God's Eye** was... interesting. I wanted to call it out because it has some issues that I've been running into a lot with sci-fi from the 60s and 70s that's increasingly difficult to ignore. *The Mote in God's Eye* features a single female human who serves 2 purposes: to be a love interest and to explain (a super conservative version of) human reproduction to aliens. I guess I'm supposed to overlook that and just enjoy the story about aliens, but I have a hard time believing that in 1974 neither of the two authors knew what they were doing when they included a passage explaining why there were no women allowed on space missions.\n\n**Red Mars** is just awesome. I can't remember if I read it before or after I committed to this list, but it stands out either way. It's a legitimate must-read in the genre and since I've read the trilogy, I intend to read more by Kim Stanley Robinson.\n\n**The Saga of Seven Suns** is one that I was not familiar with (although I've read several books by Kevin J. Anderson) and wasn't sure what to expect. I only read the first book, but I'm definitely open to reading the rest at some point. There's a lot of world-building and it promises to be a large epic the likes of which you typically expect in the Fantasy genre. It's not my favorite on the list, but it's certainly enjoyable enough and introduces some interesting ideas about aliens and interstellar diplomacy. \n\nThanks for reading my mini treatise :)\n\nEDIT: *obligatory edit about how I can't believe how much this blew up and I'm trying to keep up with my inbox and I'll eventually need to go to bed*\nFixed a mistake that only one hardcore superfan called me out on - the rest of you can never judge me now!\n"}, {"subreddit": "travel", "label": 9, "post": "Marrakesh, at sunset "}, {"subreddit": "music", "label": 6, "post": "An early 70s Stratocaster plugged straight into my new fender vibroverb amp.

Here's some more Q&A and articles on this topic:\n\n* [I know how to program, but I don't know what to program](https://www.devdungeon.com/content/i-know-how-program-i-dont-know-what-program)\n* [Learning by converting code from one language to another](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/5503pa/code_conversion_probably_the_best_tool_any_level/)\n* [Write a command-line utility](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/7m92i1/coding_idea_write_a_commandline_utility/)\n* [If you want to learn you'll need to be willing to look stupid](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/5jm97p/if_you_want_to_learn_youll_need_to_be_willing_to/)\n* [Techniques for Efficiently Learning Programming Languages](http://www.flyingmachinestudios.com/programming/learn-programming-languages-efficiently/)\n* [Things you might encounter in your programming journey](https://www.techinasia.com/talk/27-things-started-programming)\n\n## Exercises and Projects\n\nI do not have a simple answer to this question either. If you feel comfortable with programming basics and Python syntax, then exercises are a good way to test your knowledge. The resource you used to learn Python will typically have some sort of exercises, so those would be ideal as a first choice. I'd also suggest using the below resources to improve your skills. If you get stuck, reread the material related to those topics, search online, ask for clarifications, etc  \u2014 in short, make an effort to solve it. It is okay to skip some troublesome problems (and come back to it later if you have the time), but you should be able to solve most of the beginner problems. Maintaining notes will help too, especially for common mistakes.\n\n* [Exercism](https://exercism.io/tracks/python/exercises), [Practicepython](https://www.practicepython.org/), [Edabit](https://edabit.com/challenges/python3) \u2014 these are all beginner friendly and difficulty levels are marked\n* [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/), [Adventofcode](https://adventofcode.com/), [Projecteuler](https://projecteuler.net/) \u2014 more challenging\n* [Checkio](https://py.checkio.org/), [Codingame](https://www.codingame.com/start), [Codecombat](https://codecombat.com/play/level/dungeons-of-kithgard) \u2014 gaming based challenges\n* [/r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer) \u2014 not active currently, but there's plenty of past challenges with discussions\n\nOnce you are comfortable with basics and syntax, the next step is projects. I use a 10-line program that solves a common problem for me \u2014 adding `body { text-align: justify }` to `epub` files that are not justify aligned. I didn't know that this line would help beforehand, I searched online for a solution and then automated the process of unzipping `epub`, adding the line and then packing it again. That will likely need you to lookup documentation and go through some stackoverflow Q&A as well. And once you have written the solution and use it regularly, you'll likely encounter corner cases and features to be added. I feel this is a great way to learn and understand programming.\n\n* [Projects on various topics with solutions](https://github.com/karan/Projects-Solutions)\n* [Project based learning](https://github.com/tuvtran/project-based-learning#python)\n* [Pytudes by Peter Norvig](https://github.com/norvig/pytudes)\n* [Rosettacode](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Python)\n\n## Debugging\n\nKnowing how to debug your programs is crucial and should be ideally taught right from the beginning instead of a chapter at the end of the book. [Think Python](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/) is an awesome example for such a resource material.\n\nSites like [Pythontutor](http://www.pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit) allow you to visually debug a program \u2014 you can execute a program step by step and see the current value of variables. Similar feature is typically provided by IDEs like [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) and [Thonny](https://thonny.org/). Under the hood, these visualizations are using the [pdb module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html). See also [Python debugging with pdb](https://realpython.com/python-debugging-pdb/).\n\nDebugging is often a frustrating experience. Taking a break helps (and sometimes I have found the problem in my dreams). Try to reduce the code as much as possible so that you are left with minimal code necessary to reproduce the issue. Talking about the problem to a friend/colleague/inanimate-objects/etc can help too \u2014 known as [Rubber duck debugging](https://rubberduckdebugging.com/). I have often found the issue while formulating a question to be asked on forums like stackoverflow/reddit because writing down your problem is another way to bring clarity than just having a vague idea in your mind. Here's some more articles on this challenging topic:\n\n* [What does debugging a program look like?](https://jvns.ca/blog/2019/06/23/a-few-debugging-resources/)\n* [How to debug small programs](https://ericlippert.com/2014/03/05/how-to-debug-small-programs/)\n* [Debugging guide](https://uchicago-cs.github.io/debugging-guide/)\n* [Problem solving skills](https://ryanstutorials.net/problem-solving-skills/)\n\nHere's an interesting snippet (modified to keep it small) from a collection of [interesting bug stories](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/169713/whats-the-toughest-bug-you-ever-found-and-fixed).\n\n>A jpeg parser choked whenever the CEO came into the room, because he always had a shirt with a square pattern on it, which triggered some special case of contrast and block boundary algorithms.\n\nSee also [curated list of absurd software bug stories](https://500mile.email/).\n\n## Testing\n\nAnother crucial aspect in the programming journey is knowing how to write tests. In bigger projects, usually there are separate engineers (often in much larger number than code developers) to test the code. Even in those cases, writing a few sanity test cases yourself can help you develop faster knowing that the changes aren't breaking basic functionality.\n\nThere's no single consensus on test methodologies. There is [Unit testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing), [Integration testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_testing), [Test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) and so on. Often, a combination of these is used. These days, machine learning is also being considered to reduce the testing time, see [Testing Firefox more efficiently with machine learning](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2020/07/testing-firefox-more-efficiently-with-machine-learning/) for example.\n\nWhen I start a project, I usually try to write the programs incrementally. Say I need to iterate over files from a directory. I will make sure that portion is working (usually with `print` statements), then add another feature \u2014 say file reading and test that and so on. This reduces the burden of testing a large program at once at the end. And depending upon the nature of the program, I'll add a few sanity tests at the end. For example, for my [command_help](https://github.com/learnbyexample/command_help) project, I copy pasted a few test runs of the program with different options and arguments into a separate file and wrote a program to perform these tests programmatically whenever the source code is modified.\n\nFor non-trivial projects, you'll usually end up needing frameworks like built-in module `unittest` or third-party modules like `pytest`. See [Getting started with testing in Python](https://realpython.com/python-testing/) and [calmcode: pytest](https://calmcode.io/pytest/introduction.html) for discussion on these topics.\n\n## Intermediate Python resources\n\n* [Official Python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/index.html) \u2014 Python docs are a treasure trove of information\n* [Calmcode](https://calmcode.io/) \u2014 videos on testing, code style, args kwargs, data science, etc\n* [Practical Python Programming](https://dabeaz-course.github.io/practical-python/Notes/Contents.html) \u2014 covers foundational aspects of Python programming with an emphasis on script writing, data manipulation, and program organization\n* [Intermediate Python](https://book.pythontips.com/en/latest/index.html) \u2014 covers debugging, generators, decorators, virtual environment, collections, comprehensions, classes, etc\n* [Effective Python](https://www.effectivepython.com/) \u2014 insight into the Pythonic way of writing programs\n* [Fluent Python](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/fluent-python/9781491946237/) \u2014 takes you through Python\u2019s core language features and libraries, and shows you how to make your code shorter, faster, and more readable at the same time\n    * [Fluent Python, 2nd Edition](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/fluent-python-2nd/9781492056348/)\n* [Serious Python](https://nostarch.com/seriouspython) \u2014 deployment, scalability, testing, and more\n* [Pythonprogramming](https://pythonprogramming.net/) \u2014 domain based topics like machine learning, game development, data analysis, web development, etc\n* [Youtube: Corey Schafer](https://www.youtube.com/user/schafer5/playlists) \u2014 various topics for beginners to advanced users\n\n**Algorithms and Design patterns**\n\n* [Problem solving with algorithms and data structures](https://runestone.academy/runestone/static/pythonds/index.html) \n* [GitHub: Awesome algorithms](https://github.com/tayllan/awesome-algorithms)\n* [GitHub: Collection of design patterns and idioms](https://github.com/faif/python-patterns)\n* [Python design patterns](https://python-patterns.guide/) inspired from [Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns) (also known as **Gang of Four book**)\n\n## Handy cheatsheets\n\n* [Python Crash Course cheatsheet](https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc_2e/cheat_sheets/cheat_sheets/)\n* [Comprehensive Python cheatsheet](https://gto76.github.io/python-cheatsheet/)\n* [Scientific Python cheatsheet](https://ipgp.github.io/scientific_python_cheat_sheet/)\n\nI hope these resources will help you take that crucial next step and continue your Python journey.

Some general trends I've noticed and can address:\n\n* I do not have a favorite book, but I have a favorite 30 (currently 29 while I debate what will replace Spin by Robert Charles Wilson that didn't pass muster on a reread this weekend): https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/15431237-justin?shelf=meta_top_thirty&utm_campaign=mybooksnav&utm_content=mybooks_cta&utm_medium=web&utm_source=homepage\n* The string that looks like a noose is my attic access pull cord\n* Yes, I have Battlefield Earth.  It's a favorite SciFi adventure story detached from Scientology.  Lots of fun, I've read it multiple times.\n* Yes, Twilight is there.  I have read them and enjoyed them.  I did it before the movies and I have no regrets.  I have read and enjoyed many books that fall all over the continuum of quality.  I'm not a fan of bagging on books even if I didn't like them. You can keep yelling at me about it but is it really worth your time?\n* I estimate, roughly, that there are 1,200 books.  I have read somewhere between 70-80% of the whole library.  It's closer to 90% if you just count SciFi/Fantasy books.\n* Yes, the Walking Dead omnibuses are out of order.

Bigger the population, the more minorities. Don't step on the toes of the dog-lovers, the cat-lovers, doctors, lawyers, merchants, chiefs, Mormons, Baptists, Unitarians, second-generation Chinese, Swedes, Italians, Germans, Texans, Brooklynites, Irishmen, people from Oregon or Mexico. The people in this book, this play, this TV serial are not meant to represent any actual painters, cartographers, mechanics anywhere. The bigger your market, Montag, the less you handle controversy, remember that! All the minor minor minorities with their navels to be kept clean. Authors, full of evil thoughts, lock up your typewriters. They did. Magazines became a nice blend of vanilla tapioca. Books, so the damned snobbish critics said, were dishwater. No wonder books stopped selling, the critics said. But the public, knowing what it wanted, spinning happily, let the comic-books survive. And the three-dimensional sex-magazines, of course. There you have it, Montag. It didn't come from the Government down. There was no dictum, no declaration, no censorship, to start with, no! Technology, mass exploitation, and minority pressure carried the trick, thank God. Today, thanks to them, you can stay happy all the time, you are allowed to read comics, the good old confessions, or trade-journals.\"  \n\n\"Yes, but what about the firemen, then?\" asked Montag.  \n\n\"Ah.\" Beatty leaned forward in the faint mist of smoke from his pipe. \"What more easily explained and natural? With school turning out more runners, jumpers, racers, tinkerers, grabbers, snatchers, fliers, and swimmers instead of examiners, critics, knowers, and imaginative creators, the word `intellectual,' of course, became the swear word it deserved to be. You always dread the unfamiliar. Surely you remember the boy in your own school class who was exceptionally 'bright,' did most of the reciting and answering while the others sat like so many leaden idols, hating him. And wasn't it this bright boy you selected for beatings and tortures after hours? Of course it was. We must all be alike. Not everyone born free and equal, as the Constitution says, but everyone made equal. Each man the image of every other; then all are happy, for there are no mountains to make them cower, to judge themselves against. So! A book is a loaded gun in the house next door. Burn it. Take the shot from the weapon. Breach man's mind. Who knows who might be the target of the well-read man? Me? I won't stomach them for a minute. And so when houses were finally fireproofed completely, all over the world (you were correct in your assumption the other night) there was no longer need of firemen for the old purposes. They were given the new job, as custodians of our peace of mind, the focus of our understandable and rightful dread of being inferior; official censors, judges, and executors. That's you, Montag, and that's me.\""}, {"subreddit": "travel", "label": 9, "post": "Two lakes at Interlaken, Switzerland "}, {"subreddit": "books", "label": 4, "post": "Leonardo DiCaprio and Martin Scorsese Developing 'The Devil in the White City' Series at Hulu "}, {"subreddit": "books", "label": 4, "post": "Thousands of 16th, 17th and 18th century court cases - including witchcraft, missing children and swan thefts - are coming to light for the first time thanks to a Cambridge University Library archives project "}, {"subreddit": "gaming", "label": 3, "post": "After 13 years of loyal service, the inevitable finally happened.

This is unequivocally the best book series I have ever read and I don't know what to do with my life now :( This is one of those series that I'd always heard about but somehow never got around to reading. Now that I have I'm wondering where it's been all my life, but also realizing that there's a lot of concepts and intelligent existential wit in it that I might not have caught onto if I had read it when I was younger. I haven't ever read anything that was simultaneously this witty, hilarious, intelligent, and original. In fact I haven't been able to put it down since I started the first book a week or two ago. It's honestly a bit difficult to put into words how brilliant this series is, in so many different ways - suffice it to say that if there was any piece of literature that captured my perspective and spirit, this is it.\n\nI just finished the fourth book, which took all of Adam's charm and applied it to one of the most poignantly touching love stories I've ever read, and now I don't know what to do with my life. I feel like I've experienced everything I wanted life to offer me through the eyes of Arthur Dent, and now that I'm back in my own skin in my own vastly different and significantly more boring life I'm feeling a sense of loss. This is coming as a bit of a surprise since I wasn't expecting to find this kind of substance from these books. I had always imagined that they were just some silly, slap-stick humor type sci-fi books.\n\nBesides ranting about the meaning these books have to me and my own sadness that the man who created them is no longer with us, I also wanted to create this post to ask you guys two things:\n\n1) Should I read Mostly Harmless? The general consensus I've gotten is that it takes the beauty of the fourth book and takes it in a depressing direction, and I'd really much rather end this journey on the note it's on right now (as has been recommended to me more than a few times). But at the same time I want so badly to read more HHGttG. So I'm feeling a bit torn. Also, what about the 6th book that eion colfer wrote?\n\n2) Are there any other books out there that come anywhere close to the psychedelic wit, hilarity, and spirit that this series has? I've heard dirk gently recommended more than a few times, and I'm about 1 or 2 chapters into it right now but it hasn't captivated me in the same way that HHGttG did. I'm going to continue on with it anyway though since Adams was behind it.\n\nSo long, Douglas Adams... and thanks for all the fish. :'(\n\nEdit: Wow, wasn't expecting this to explode like this. I think it's gunna take me the next few years to get through my inbox lol. \n\nI've got enough recommendations in this thread to keep me reading for a couple lifetimes lol - but Pratchett, Gaiman, and Vonnegut are definitely the most common ones, so I'll definitely be digging into that content. And there's about as many people vehemently stating that I shouldn't read mostly harmless as there are saying that I should. Still a bit unsure about it but I'm thinking I'll give it a bit of time to let the beauty of the first four books fade into my memory and then come back and check it out. \n\nThanks for the reviews and recommendations everybody!

I will try to be as brief as I can in my back story to keep this as relevant to Python as possible, but I feel it would be a disservice to leave it out completely, as my issues with mental health were a primary driver of the motivation I took advantage of to learn Python. I will post a more detailed description of my backstory later in r/addiciton or r/depression_help or something similar. Feel free to skip to the second \\*\\*\\* to go straight to when I started learning python, however I suggest you read the whole post because honestly my whole story is relevant. If I hadn't gone through what I went through, I doubt I would have had the motivation to self-teach myself Python. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\* \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI grew up in a wealthy, extremely homogenous town within an hour of New York City. I went to a public school, but if you saw the way people dressed, it looked more like a private prep school. The vast majority of the kids in my school had parents who were millionaires. My parents were not. I was an only child, and I grew up in a small apartment on the \"poor\" side of town (\"poor\" meaning houses/ apartments went for < 750k). As you can imagine, the social structure of the school was entirely based off the wealth of your parents. So the game was rigged against me from the beginning. I had very few friends at a young age, and most people in my middle school probably would have described me as a \"loser\" or another synonymous term. I was very unhappy and became addicted to video games as a mean to escape my life. During high school, I finally started branching out to meet people from the surrounding towns, who were not nearly as pretentious as the people I grew up with. I made a lot of friends and started to have a legitimate social life. However, with this new social life came a lot of superficiality and drinking/drug using. \n\nUntil my senior year of high school, my grades were mediocre at best. Because I hated my social life at school, I hated school in general. But in my senior year, something changed. I won't detail it in this post, but will certainly get into it more in my next post in r/addiction or r/depression_help . I improved my grades and went to community college for my first year. I ended that year with a 3.9 GPA and an acceptance to one of the best colleges in my state. I transferred to that college and thought my life from there on out would be perfect. I was wrong.\n\nI hated the social scene of my college. I found it to be very superficial and revolved almost entirely around drinking. Later I realized that while this was true for the people I was surrounding myself with, nobody forced me to surround myself with those people. I did it because I thought that this was the only way to enjoy college, and if I didn't, I would be missing out on the experience of my life. Man, what a load of BS I let myself believe. This expectation set me up for failure, and I blamed myself entirely. I thought I was worthless, a loser, and that all the mean things people said about me in my hometown back in middle school were true. I fell into a deep depression and eventually dropped out. \n\nTowards the end of my time away at this state school, I saw a psychiatrist who prescribed me Adderall and Xanax to treat my depression and learning disabilities. In the beginning, they worked wonders, but they certainly didn't solve the underlying issues, they actually made them worse. After I dropped out, I began to rely on them completely. Before long, I was blacking out all the time as a result of the Xanax, and up for days at a time as a result of the Adderall. It was always one or the other, and I had to use the other to counter the negative effects of one. \n\nFor the next few years, I battled with addiction and depression to the point where I felt hopeless. I would get a week or two or three sober, then relapse. Somehow I managed to go back to a local college during this time, but my grades were mediocre, because I would miss a week of school every time I would relapse. Eventually I went away to rehab for four months. This is where I started to learn Python. I was very fortunate to have parents who loved me enough to spend the money to send me to a place for four months. I know not everyone has this privilege, and it is my goal to pay my parents back the money they spent on me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe rehab I went to was basically in the middle of nowhere, and while I was inpatient the first month, the last three months I was in what was essentially a nicer version of a sober house. I worked part- time at a restaurant (\\~20 hours a week). I had computer access, and I found myself very bored during the first week or two, so I decided to learn something I had always wanted to learn: Programming. I bought a few courses off [udemy.com](https://udemy.com) for \\~$12/each (NEVER pay full price of a Udemy course. You can always get them discounted), and started learning. Pretty much anytime I wasn't working or going to AA meetings, I was programming. I essentially replaced my addiction to drugs with an addiction to learning. I really enjoyed it, but in hindsight, I overdid it, as any addict does. I came home after four months, and I fell back into old patterns, and relapsed just before I would have been 6 months sober. I will go into more detail about this in my posts in r/addiction / r/depression_help .\n\nDuring my time in rehab, I completed 3 Udemy courses on Python, but honestly I only really learned the fundamentals. I've never been a very quick learner, as I have a processing disorder (I was always the last one to finish tests in school and it always took me longer to do assignments etc). I frequently got frustrated, and rarely took breaks. I would spend 4-8 hours a day practicing coding, but much of that time was obsessing over one thing that I couldn't figure out. This was a big part of why I burnt myself out. Later, I found that if I ran into a problem I couldn't figure out, and forced myself to take a break, 95% of the time I would figure it out within 10 minutes of coming back from a 15-20 minute break. The mind is funny like that. \n\nFast forward about 6 months and I was back in rehab, this time for only 30 days. I came home and luckily got an internship at a very small investment firm, where they used python to trade stocks algorithmically. There, I had a boss who was a very good programmer, and he gave me real projects to do that required me to think critically. He rarely gave me any help. Most of the time when I asked a question he would say \"I know the answer, but you have to figure it out. It's the only way you'll learn\". This frustrated me at the time, but looking back it was probably one of the best things anyone ever did for me. I developed resourcefulness and patience, two incredibly imperative skills for any programmer who wants to be worth his/her salt. During this time, I was taking a few classes at a local college to finally finish my degree, and I was working anywhere from 15-40 hours a week at this investment firm, unpaid. I honestly worked a bit too hard, I almost burnt myself out again, but I managed to get through it. I was very lucky in that my parents helped me financially during this time, which allowed me to focus more on school and work. I had a few relapses during this period, but they were short and mild, so it didn't throw me off track too badly. \n\nOver this past summer I finished up my degree (I majored in Business) and started looking for jobs. I was sure to put as much of my accomplishments at the small investment firm that involved python on my resume as I could. Covid was (and is) still wreaking havoc on the economy, so I worked extra hard applying to jobs, making connections, and keeping my skills sharp. I honestly probably applied to over 2500 jobs. I only got maybe 3-4 interviews. I had one during the end of the summer that went to the final round, and I was sure I was going to get the job. I didn't. Instead, the company (according to a connection I had made within the company cold-emailing people) decided to hire people from India to save money. I definitely felt pretty hopeless at that point. But I didn't give up. Maybe a month later, I got an interview for a job at a major company as a Data Analyst. I had three rounds of interviews plus I had to send them examples of some of my Python projects. I didn't get my hopes up like I did last time, out of fear of being disappointed. To my surprise, I got the job. I had asked for a 50k salary. They gave me 60k base plus a 5k bonus contingent on my performance, plus great benefits. \n\nI've been at this job for a little over a month, and I honestly love it. I find myself excited to go to work every day, and the people really like me because I am able to provide real value to the company. In my first month, I worked a lot on automation of otherwise very manual tasks (usually involving excel or emails). I would ask people how many hours per week they would generally spend on such a task and wrote it down. I recently did the math and realized that I have so far saved the company over 750 hours of work per year, and that\u2019s a conservative estimate using a 48 week year (to account for holidays, vacation etc.) and the low end of their estimated range of hours per week. This frees the employees up to work on more value added (and frankly much more interesting) projects. My work there is just beginning, and there are a ton of projects I am really excited about. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\### (Please go to the next ### if you have no interest in hearing anything non-Python related)\n\nI can honestly say I am happy now. I have over 4 months sober, and I rarely have any cravings to use drugs anymore. I really think this is largely because I found purpose in my life. That said, I still attend AA meetings often because I know I have to keep my sobriety my first priority. Without it, I have nothing. I also know that life isn't going to be perfect every day. While I do consider myself happy today, I still have bad days. Such is life. I stopped expecting to feel good all the time. Life is not designed that way. Before, I was only \"happy\" if I had a substance in my system. Also, \"happy\" to me was a euphoric rush which felt good, but was never fulfilling. Now I define happiness differently. It doesn't mean I feel good all the time. It means that despite sometimes not feeling good, I can appreciate how lucky I am to be alive and how blessed I am to have been given a second chance. Getting out of the rut that I found myself in a few years ago was the hardest thing I have ever done, but it was 100% worth it. At the risk of sounding corny, I really do believe sometimes you have to fall down hard and struggle getting back up to appreciate your life. \n\n\\###\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLearning Python was part of my journey, and it wasn't easy at all. When I started, I had a lot of doubts that I could do it. I didn't think \"people like me\" would be successful at something like this. Again, I was wrong. While I am certainly not even close to an expert at Programming/Python, I am good enough to be hired at a large company and good enough to make a difference. I'm sure there are people on Reddit and elsewhere that could make me look like I started programming last week. But I try not to compare myself to others. I instead try to compare myself to who I was before, and who I want to be in the future. As I\u2019ve said several times before, I will make another post with more details about my experience with addiction/depression and give my general tips for life there, but for now here are my general tips for learning Python:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. I suggest starting with the fundamentals. I used Jose Portilla's Udemy course for this and it was great. I will link it at the bottom along with some other resources.\n\n2. If you struggle motivating yourself to follow online courses, try figuring out a real project to do that can actually help you in everyday life. This could be automating something you do in your job, for school, or just something you think will be fun. \n\n3. Work Hard. Don't give up. But don't burn yourself out. Take frequent breaks, especially when you get frustrated. \n\n4. Ask for help. If you\u2019re struggling with a specific problem, r/learnpython is great, along with [Stackoverflow.com](https://Stackoverflow.com) . People have helped me with many problems there.\n\n5. Trust the Process. Programming is a lot like learning an instrument in my opinion. At first it can be grueling and you won\u2019t be able to do much for a while, but after you learn the fundamentals, it becomes incredibly enjoyable. \n\n6. Be consistent. This is extremely important. Try to set aside a time every day to practice. Even if it\u2019s only 20-30 minutes. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are many more tips that I have but those are the most important ones I can think of. Please feel free to follow me as I hope to be quite active on reddit in the future. If you have any questions, please message me. Whether it's about Python, Addiction, Depression, or whatever else. I'll do my best to answer everyone I can. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks."}, {"subreddit": "science", "label": 2, "post": "Researchers teleport information within a diamond.

Here's my top 15 list. Let me start by saying this is the list of books that \\*\\*I enjoyed\\*\\*.  I'm not saying that #1 is better than #10, I'm simply saying I enjoyed it more.   Not all of these books have crazy symbolism and story arcs and deep character/world building, some of them were just fun reads.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have read nearly every classic science fiction book available, and a lot of contemporary and non-classics as well.  Also, a disclaimer: there is no cyberpunk in here, no Stephenson or Gibson.  I have tried to read several cyberpunk authors and simply didn't find them enjoyable, despite the talent that is clearly present in their writings and world building skills.  Oh, and I haven't read the Foundation series, so that's why it's not on here (yet).   \n\n\nApologies for not doing a top 25 (or even a top 100 that was requested), I just don't have the time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, without further ado, here are my top 15:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. **The Sparrow (Mary Doria Russell)** **-** I addressed this in my previous post, I thought this book was fantastic. The first half is slow, yes, but the second half more than made up for it in my opinion.  A Jesuit priest and his friends discover singing coming from a planet 4-5 light years away.  The Jesuits are the first to be able to mount an expedition to this new planet, and the priest and his friends are the crew selected to lead it.  The story starts with the priest, back on Earth after the trip, and all of humanity wants him dead or imprisoned.  This book gave me a more intense emotional reaction than any book I've ever read.  I literally shouted out loud \"NO NO no no no no no no...\" at one point and had to put it down for the day.\n2. **Hyperion Series (Dan Simmons)** \\- The Sparrow knocked this out of first place, yes, but I haven't read the sequel to it, so as far as series of books go, this one is at the top bar none.  I preferred the first two books, but the second two were very fun reads as well.  7 people are selected all around the universe to venture into the Time Tombs in a mysterious planet with a violent and murderous monster on it known as the Shrike.  That's all I can say, this story is so sprawling that anything more than that just doesn't do it justice. Just an all around unbelievable experience.\n3. **The Stand (Steven King)** \\- A virus wipes out 99% of the population, and the survivors have dreams that direct them to either Boulder, CO, where civilization is starting to rebuild (symbolically Heaven), or Las Vegas, which is more a Mad-Max-everyones-killing-each-other-no-laws-type society (symbolically Hell). Whether you consider it science fiction or not, this deserves to make the list.  Loved this one.  I've heard it compared to Swan Song, so I was excited to pick that up, but was ultimately disappointed.  There's no argument to be made for SS being better than The Stand.\n4. **I, Robot (Isaac Asimov) -** I picked this book up semi-dreading the read, and just trying to work my way through the classics.  I figured it was one of those classics that everyone wants to have read but no one wants to read.  I was dead wrong.  I knew it was going to make a statement about A.I., but I didn't know how entertaining it was going to be.  Every story, every section, every word was also run to read, and the writing style kept my attention from start to finish.\n5. **Dune (Frank Herbert) -** No surprise here, it's an absolute classic. Not much to say about this book that hasn't already been said.  If you haven't read it, do so immediately.\n6. **The Forge of God** **(Greg Bear)** \\- An alien lands in the United States, and the only message he can give us before he dies is \"I'm sorry, I'm too late\" or something to that effect.  I love alien contact novels, and this was probably my favorite.  Sprawling, a lot of characters, a lot of viewpoints and different situation.  Huge action, a real page-turner.  This isn't the most philosophical or complex book, but it is a massively fun read. And the end, damn the end was crazy. I could definitely see it being made into a movie, but it doesn't have the feel of a novel written *specifically* to be made into a movie.\n7. **The Forever War (Joe Haldeman) -** I believe this was the first military sci-fi book I read.  I didn't know much about military sci-fi and was doubtful that I would like it, especially since it sounded like a parallel of the Vietnam War.  Again, dead wrong. This book has a lot to say, and it says it extremely eloquently.  Humanity is in an interstellar war against the Taurens, and the soldiers who visit home (because of time dilation) visit after huge periods of time, so it's a good take on where humanity will be in 500, 1000, and 10000 years from now. Again, this one was hard to put down.  \n8. **Not Alone (Craig Falconer)** \\- A lot of you probably haven't heard of this book, I think it's pretty obscure.  Why is it so high up on this list?  Well some of my favorite novels are alien first-contact novels, and my favorite *parts* of those novels are the moments between a group of people finding out about the existence of ETs and whole world finding out about them.  This book is that idea under a magnifying glass. A UFO enthusiast stumbles upon incontrovertible evidence that not only do aliens exist, but that humanity has had contact with them for years.  And what does he do?  He leaks it anonymously on Twitter, which of course leads to a melt down as the world sees the evidence.  Great book, in fact I enjoyed it so much I messaged Craig Falconer on Facebook after I finished it just to tell him what a fun read I thought it was.\n9. **The Sirens of Titan (Kurt Vonnegut) -** An interstellar story as only Vonnegut could tell it. My favorite Vonnegut book besides maybe his Welcome to the Monkey House collection of short stories.  If you've never read any Vonnegut, I'd still say it's a great place to start.\n10. **Nightfall (Isaac Asimov + Robert Silverberg)** \\- Takes place on a planet in a multiple star solar system that never experiences night.  Within even 15 minutes of pure darkness, residents of the planet lose their minds or even die. Scientists on the planet discover that once every 2000 years, there is a total solar eclipse that leave the planet in complete darkness, which matches up with the fact that once every 2000 years their entire civilization completely caves in.  Of course they make this discovery very close to the 2000 year mark.\n11. **Old Man's War (John Scalzi) -** Military sci-fi, the elderly can basically get a complete regeneration of their body, restoring them to their 20s, if they agree to fight in an interstellar war.  I'm not making it sound very interesting, but it was a great read.\n12. **Childhood's End (Arthur C. Clarke) -** Mmmm love me some Arthur C. Clarke. A peaceful alien invasion happens, with the result being that the aliens will share a technology, etc, if humanity agrees to end all wars, ban slavery, things of that nature.  Humans do, and the results humanity sees within themselves, and the changes the Overlords bring make quite the interesting novel.\n13. **Spin (Robert Charles Wilson) -** One night, all the stars go out.  It's discovered that someone or something has put a permeable membrane all around Earth, and no one knows why.  Of course our protagonist dedicates his life to figuring out what's going on.  I particularly liked the ending to this book.  Great read, fun.\n14. **Starship Troopers (Robert Heinlein)-** Another military sci fi in the vein of Old Man's War and The Forever War.  I think I read all 3 of these back to back.  They're sort of the heavy hitters of the military sci-fi genre, and I loved everyone one of them.  Other military sci-fi I've tried to read, and they just don't do it for me. \n15. **Footfall (Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle)** \\- Almost forgot this one, but it's about an alien invasion where the aliens aren't *that* far ahead of humans, technologically.  And they show up to our planet expecting us to still be in the stone age, so they're surprised when they see how little time it's taken us to come so far.  Extremely entertaining, and gives viewpoints from both human and alien characters.  The only thing I didn't like was how the aliens supposedly looked.  Like baby elephants, pretty much.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Honorable Mentions:** Ringworld, Out of the Dark, I am Legend, The Three-Body Problem, War of the Worlds, Rendezvous with Rama, Calculating God, Roadside Picnic, The Puppet Masters\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYes, I'm sure I've forgotten some good ones, be it intentionally or not, I'm writing this over my lunch break.  \n\n\nAnyway, that's my list.  Hope you enjoyed, and hopefully it gave you some recommendations for future reading.  Feel free to message me for specific recommendations or anything else.\n\n\nEdit: Yep forgot the Enders Game series, probably should be on there. I read it like 30 times when I was a kid and sometimes forget it\u2019s even science fiction.\n\nEdit2: Since I guess I'm on the front page now, here's a quick edit.  I know I should read the Foundation Series, The Culture series, and Vinge's A Fire Upon the Deep.  I read before bed a lot and these huge, sprawling space operas can sometimes be a lot after a long day.  And I stand by decision to put Starship Troopers over Stranger in a Strange Land, but I'll allow that both Stranger and Moon is a Harsh Mistress should probably have been an honorable mention.  Also for any of you that read or have read #8, Not Alone, I'd love to know what you think about it.\n\nEdit3: All right, all right, I'll join GoodReads.

My love for reading quickly rekindled, it became one book a week. I just finished book 52 this year. Here are my favorites: **The Girl With Seven Names** by Hyeonseo Lee\n\nI can\u2019t help but add the very first book that started the frenzy off. The story of a young girl who defected from North Korea was so riveting, I finished it in three days. She had a TED talk as well for those who are interested. \n\n\n**The Book Thief** by Markus Zusak\n\nThe WW2 era always fascinated me, and the story of a young girl in Nazi Germany shows a side to the war us Americans rarely see. Tragedy, love, and a passion for reading kept me entangled for too many late nights on this one.\n\n\n**The Long Way To A Small Angry Planet** by Becky Chambers\n\nI really should include all three of her \u201cWayfarer\u201d series in this, as well as her latest fourth book. This was a Reddit Book Club section that I enjoyed SO much, I immediately bought the remaining two: \u201cA Closed and Common Orbit\u201d and \u201cRecord of a Spaceborn Few\u201d. Chambers has a way of writing such believable science fiction without sounding dull or over the top. I wish she had more novels out.\n\n\n**A Thousand Splendid Suns** and **Kite Runner** by Khaled Hosseini \n\nBoth of Hosseini\u2019s books take place in the tumultuous Middle East during times of peace and then times of conflict. The contrast between both time frames and how it affected the characters pulled some big ugly tears from me a few times. He writes with such depth I found myself ordering \u201cAnd The Mountains Echoed\u201d to read next.\n\n\n**Where the Crawdads Sing** by Delia Owens\n\nDon\u2019t judge a book by its cover and don\u2019t assume a \u201cswamp rat\u201d is just that. I was recommended this one and I\u2019ve learned to listen to my friends; they clearly know what I will enjoy. Every recommendation I chose to read I was thoroughly entertained. \n\n\n**Born a Crime** by Trevor Noah\n\nIf you think Trevor Noah is funny in his stand-up comedy, you will laugh at his childhood memoir about growing up in South Africa. Definitely had me chuckling out loud.\n\n\n**The Goldfinch** by Donna Tartt\n\nI did not expect this to be such a long book. When it showed up at my door I wondered what I got myself into. The first few chapters I still thought I was crazy. But I have a rule: get halfway through at least before you give up. I maybe got a half dozen chapters in before I knew I\u2019d never give it up. I\u2019ve been told the movie was less than entertaining however so I probably will skip it. \n\n\n**The Huntress** by Kate Quinn\n\nAnother one recommended by a friend and sure enough I stayed awake far too late some nights because I couldn\u2019t put this down. Told from the point of view of each of the main characters, the intertwining as it progresses is a style I\u2019ve found I enjoy very much. I\u2019m told Quinn\u2019s other book \u201cThe Alice Network\u201d is also one I need to read.\n\n\n**Entire Harry Potter Series** by JK Rowling\n\nI spent well over a decade refusing to read Harry Potter or watch any of the movies. I resisted purely because it was so trendy. I\u2019m not a \u201crebel\u201d or anything, I just didn\u2019t want to get caught up in SUCH a strong craze. Well now I know WHY it was so immensely popular. Oh and yes, now I have seen the movies as well :)\n\n\nEDIT: thank you so much for the support and for the shiny metal! This sub has been so informative and I\u2019m so grateful for all the books it has led me to read. You all rock!\n\nEDIT 2: lots of people have asked\n\n1) How could I go so long without reading?! After high school life just got in the way and my time management was poor back then. I wish I had books as a refuge for some dark times though, and I hope anyone trying to get back into reading is successful.\n\n2) How do I stay so focused or read so quickly? I used to wander off in thought a lot and it got worse and my list of worries grew as an adult. Now, I sit with the audio version as well as the physical book and it keeps me focused. \n\n3) Do I buy brand new books, used, library etc? I love the feel of real books. But this can be more expensive than an electronic reader for sure. Thrift stores, garage sales, used book sales, and Amazon have been my saving grace. I found my entire hard cover Harry Potter set at a thrift store in fact. Took a few trips to get it all but at $3 a book it was worth it.\n\nPLEASE keep the recommendations coming!! Of all the books I chose to read this year maybe five were of my own choosing. Most were from Reddit, friends, family, and various articles online.

While it is intended for beginners, some have claimed that they needed more hand-holding than this book provided for them. So I currently recommend it as an introductory and intermediate book for developers that are looking to learn Python.\n\nWhen I originally wrote the book, I noticed that there were few or no books available that described how to create executables of your code or distribute your code via Python\u2019s Package Index (PyPI). Python 101 covers these topics as well as introducing the reader to Python\u2019s standard library, how to install 3rd party packages and an introduction to some of the most popular 3rd party packages for Python, such as SQLAlchemy, requests and virtualenv.\n\nPython 101 has **5 sections, 44 chapters and 295 pages**.\n\nYou can get Python 101 for free on Leanpub using the following link: http://leanpub.com/python_101/c/48hours\n\nIf you happen to have a [Gumroad](https://gum.co/bppWr) account, then you\u2019ll be able to get the book free there as well by using the following offer code: **48hours**\n\nYou will get the **PDF**, **epub** and **mobi** versions of the book. You can see a full table of contents on the Leanpub site\n\nIf you like my first book, you can get its sequel, **Python 201: Intermediate Python** for **50%** off here: http://leanpub.com/python201/c/50percent\n\nI also write a fun [Python blog](http://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/) that has many other tutorials on it."}, {"subreddit": "music", "label": 6, "post": "The Offspring - You are gonna go far, Kid [Punk Rock] "}, {"subreddit": "travel", "label": 9, "post": "Up in the air in Cappadocia "}, {"subreddit": "politics", "label": 7, "post": "President Trump has committed treason "}, {"subreddit": "science", "label": 2, "post": "An \u2018EpiPen\u2019 for spinal cord injuries, an injection of nanoparticles that can prevent the body\u2019s immune system from overreacting to trauma, potentially preventing some spinal cord injuries from resulting in paralysis, has been demonstrated successfully in mice, without the side effects of steroids.

Let me explain... It\u2019s one thing to not like her music, which is fine, to each their own. It\u2019s another thing to construct a series of conspiracies so you don\u2019t have to believe a teenage girl can make music. The amount of vitriol being thrown at a teenage girl by grown ass men is frankly\ninsane, especially considering the amount of false information being spread about a completely harmless pop artist. Let\u2019s break down some of the crazier things tons of people on Reddit are saying...\n\n\u2018Her parents are heavily connected in the industry and she\u2019s only famous because they\u2019re famous.\u2019 \n\nOh really, who are her parents? Are they house hold names? Wait, no, they\u2019re low level actors with a few bit parts to their name and one low budget movie they made together. The biggest role either of her parents have gotten is voice acting on Mass Effect 2. They\u2019re not record producers, they\u2019re not famous musicians, they\u2019re not elite media types.  They\u2019re unknown artists who probably have less clout in the industry than a small town radio DJ. You\u2019re telling me they had enough power to make her music career go off, but not enough to make their own careers go off? \n\n\u2018Her music and image are formed by her label, she\u2019s made by a committee.\u2019 \n\nShe co-writes and makes all her music with her brother in his small room in their parents modest, middle class house. Need proof? [Here you go](https://youtu.be/ZBJ914ha6LQ). They\u2019re weren\u2019t uber wealthy before her career took off, and they\u2019re not controlled by their label. If anything, they\u2019re more intimate and more authentic than 99% of musicians out there. How many musicians do you know that don\u2019t record in a studio, but in a small bedroom? That\u2019s more DIY than the majority of indie bands. She also has strong creative control over her videos, and even directed one of them. And if the studio is dictating her fashion and style, why does she wear gigantic clothes and chunky sneakers (the same clothes she wore before she was famous)? She very specially avoids sexualizing herself like all female pop artists do (which is also fine). \n\nIf your only real argument for her being an industry plant is that her label has promoted the shit out of her through interviews and music videos, duh genius, that\u2019s what record labels do. That\u2019s their job. Having the full support of her label doesn\u2019t make her a \u2018plant.\u2019 They\u2019ve done this with every major artist in history. By this logic The Beatles, The Clash, and Queen are \u2018industry plants.\u2019\n\nThe irony of people singling in on an artist who co-creates all of her music with her own brother (with no other writers and producers), does it by themselves in a small bedroom, and calling her \u2018inauthentic\u2019 is astounding. For years Redditors complained about pop stars with 50 songwriters contributing to each song, and finally a pop star comes along who writes all her music with her brother, and they throw a fit. \n\nWhat it comes down to is grown men believing a teenage girl is incapable of making authentic music and must be the product of famous parents and a record industry creating her out of thin air. It\u2019s sad, and frankly sexist at this point. When Arctic Monkeys blew up as teenagers and were heavily promoted by their label, no one claimed they were \u2018inauthentic\u2019 and an \u2018industry plant.\u2019\n\nDislike her music all you want, just don\u2019t parrot lies and half truths because you can\u2019t believe a teenage girl can create hit music.\n\nEDIT: well this blew up. To everyone saying you don\u2019t like her music, once again, that\u2019s fine. That\u2019s not the point I was making. To everyone saying I\u2019m an industry plant as well, I wish."}, {"subreddit": "sports", "label": 8, "post": "Shaq could literally dunk on the whole team at once "}, {"subreddit": "books", "label": 4, "post": "Ursula K.

Violence the \u201csupreme authority?\u201d \n\nWithout narrowing the possible discussion, I would like to know not only what you think of the above passage, but of other passages in the book as well.\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for the upvotes and comments! I did not expect to have this much of a discussion when I first posted this. However, as a fan of the book (and the movie) it is awesome to see this thread light up. I cannot, however, take full, or even half, credit for the discussion this thread has created. I simply posted an idea from an author who is no longer with us. Whether you agree or disagree with passages in Robert Heinlein's book, Starship Troopers, I believe it is worthwhile to remember the human behind the book. He was a man who, like many of us, served in the military, went through a divorce, shifted from one area to another on the political spectrum, and so on. He was no super villain trying to shove his version of reality on others. He was a science-fiction author who, like many other authors, implanted his ideas into the stories of his books. If he were still alive, I believe he would be delighted to know that his ideas still spark a discussion to this day."}, {"subreddit": "travel", "label": 9, "post": "M\u00fcrren, Swiss Alps.

Hello,\n\nTLDR: Managed to automate something practical which is a milestone for me.\n\nI recently found some resources I wanted to use on the net. I wanted to pull the pages to pdf or some other file type so as to have it on my kindle and just have it available offline. The issue was the resources are some 500 pages and are scripted so using wget was getting me nowhere as the content of the page wasn't being downloaded. I had previously tried querying the net for a solution to this but had at that point come up empty.\n\nInstead I decided to use python and the pyautogui and make a script that would perform the command inputs through keyboard and mouse... aaaaaand.... it works!\n\nI've so far managed to get through 3/5 of the resources with this. And the best thing is I don't have to do it myself.\n\nIs it pretty? Its not ugly, but its not having an open casket funeral.\n\nDoes it work perfectly? No, I have to sit and glance over on it every few minutes to make sure it hasn't caught itself in some sort of loop driven by the existential dread of realization that this is all this program is going to do.\n\nbut does it work? YES!\n\nAnd to be honest I can't be more proud of it for that reason. I've written some code that has untied my hands and is allowing me to work while it does its job. This is the first time I've been able to accomplish this in the 5 or so years I've had my on/off relationship with coding. All it took was a couple of hours of tinkering and getting things just right. Way less than if I would have to do it by hand. And I have to add that I enjoyed this as a process. Finding all the edge cases that made it not work, adapting it so it would process the commands functionally, dodging pitfalls because of differences from page to page. I mean it even uses the copy paste function of pyperclip to test text in different parts of the page to determine what it should do.\n\nI also did it in python. Which is kind of surprising to me. Mostly because I don't really like python.\n\nWell, I enjoy using it, cause of how simple and adaptive it is. But I just don't enjoy the structure or the method of invoking classes etc. It may be similar to the other languages I've been using, but its just not my cup of coffee. This experience just proved to me it's not about the language itself, its about how you use it and I won't be dropping python any time soon.\n\nI just wanted to write this post because I think I've reached a milestone in coding that has previously eluded me and that is practical application of coding to make my day a little easier and I couldn't have achieved it without python and the python community."}, {"subreddit": "technology", "label": 5, "post": "EU aims to abolish planned obsolescence "}, {"subreddit": "entertainment", "label": 0, "post": "Dolly Parton Surprises Husband with Playboy Bunny Photoshoot "}, {"subreddit": "politics", "label": 7, "post": "U.S. Postal Service officials ordered to appear in court after failing to comply with federal judge\u2019s ballot-sweep order "}, {"subreddit": "travel", "label": 9, "post": "Winter is a great time to visit Venice "}, {"subreddit": "books", "label": 4, "post": "Friendly reminder that YA books are for teenagers. Now before you jump on me, this is not an adults can't read YA post. This is a adults who read YA need to remember who YA is for post. \n\nI've been floating around the arc (advanced reader copy) circuit for a while. Read some good stuff, read some bad, read some meh. This past weekend I had the privilege of reading one of the best books I've had the privilege of reading in a long time. YA fantasy that was beautifully written and equal parts dark, funny and suspenseful. The teenaged characters acted authentically like teenagers, which unfortunately is incredibly rare in YA. \n\nEdit: For those who are interested, the book is Remnants of Atonement by G.P McKenna. It doesn't release until October, so likely only available through netgalley, but if you have an account and enjoy ya fantasy, I highly recommend requesting it. \n\nToday I logged on to leave my feedback and thought I would nosey around in the reviews, only for my heart to sink. Everybody seemed to agree the plot was good and the writing was fantastic, but so many people were complaining that the characters acted too much like teenagers. One reviewer even praised the plot but only gave it one star because \"it was too obvious that the characters were 15/16 years old and that annoyed me.\"\n\nAgain, these are YA books. They are intended for teenaged readers. If you enjoy reading them too, that's great, but understand that. If you find teenagers annoying, go read literally anything else. You have the rest of the book store, the rest of the library. Don't complain that the 16 year old character acts too much like a 16 year old because what happens then is -because as adults we have the money - the market will continue to push YA characters who are 35 year old accountants stuck in the body of a 17 year old assassin. The list of books teenagers can relate to goes down, isolating them from their own catagory. \n\nLong story short, let teenagers read teenaged characters who act like teenagers. Stop isolating real life teenagers by appropriating the ya catagory when you have every other book to choose from if you don't like the teenaged voice. Support young readers by letting ya characters be kids!"}, {"subreddit": "politics", "label": 7, "post": "Trump\u2019s medical bill would cost an average American citizen at least $100k, report says "}, {"subreddit": "sports", "label": 8, "post": "Michael Jordan\u2019s ball faking ability "}, {"subreddit": "entertainment", "label": 0, "post": "Mumbai: TV actor arrested for \u2018raping\u2019 five-year-old girl "}, {"subreddit": "travel", "label": 9, "post": "View of the Great Pyramids of Giza from the rooftop terrace of my AirBnb "}, {"subreddit": "gaming", "label": 3, "post": "The best video game episode television has ever seen "}, {"subreddit": "gaming", "label": 3, "post": "I Asked A Tennis Racket Company To Make Me Real Life Waluigi And Wario Rackets For Comic-Con.

Not much is known except French (like American) police must release someone if there is no evidence in a certain time period. That time period is 24 hours unless proper cause is determined to extend to 48 total hours. This is why Brown was able to leave the country after a few days.\n\n-----\n\nI'm just gonna say, how is this guy still popular? He's been to jail for assault more times than I've gotten an A on an exam. And this is just what we know about. What else is there that isn't public?\n\nEdit: Sort by controversial if you want to see some stupidity.\n\nEdit 2: Since apparently people are questioning the motive:\n\nI didn't plan this for days or anything. I literally saw his name trending on Twitter at ~3pm today and said \"Hey, isn't this guy a major duche canoe? Let's remind the world of him shall we?\" A quick google search later, I found 3 articles that were compiled lists of things he's directly done wrong. For years that were missing from the lists, I did a different search specifically for that year. I checked every post on this list. They all happened. At this point, it doesn't matter *why* they happened because I'm pretty sure there's 0 excuse for a police standoff outside your own home right? Or am I just crazy? \n\nIDK. I don't have a motive in this other than to remind the world that this guy exists. If people in other industries can be torn down by ONE accusation (see Toby from Tobuscus) then why is Brown still thriving when he's got over a dozen under his belt? And to make it even worse, most of them he's been officially convicted of. Like, spent time in jail, convicted.\n\nI seem to have made my point. Anything that's not ^^^ was purely coincidental or made up by you. It was not my intention and likely never will be. I've read every top level comment that's been responded here. All 1.5k of you or something.\n\nI know we can \"separate the art from the artist\" but that doesn't make much sense does it? In other industries, people accused of harassment lose their jobs and have their careers stripped without being proven guilty. Meanwhile, Serial Abuser Chris Brown here (and others in the music industry) are perfectly fine with beating and raping people and still being praised as a \"king/queen\" or \"hero.\" It's disgusting. We need a Weinstein era purge of the music industry. Get rid of these garbage humans. Most of the time, they're only useful for their voice and *lots* of people have those.\n\nYou know what, screw it. I'm going to start addressing him a \"Serial Abuser Chris Brown\" now. Not just \"(Serial Abuser) Chris Brown.\"\n\nEdit 3: And.... locked. Racists and others of the like are out in full swing on this post. Just a couple reminders.\n\nMost of this ^^^ isn't \"Alleged\", especially the Rihanna incident. He was found guilty so he is guilty. \n\nSecondly, this is a list of things that factually happened. There's no \"Allegedly\" to having a police standoff. That for a fact happened."}, {"subreddit": "travel", "label": 9, "post": "One of the most beautiful cities I have visited.

I've read Walden four times in the last ten years. I re-read it whenever I feel like I need recentering or if I need something to take me out of today's problems (many of them today which caused my fourth re-read) and it upsets and frustrates me thinking of the thousands of high schoolers who graduate every year being unintentionally (or intentionally?) misled about the points Thoreau was trying to make by clueless english teachers.\n\n**This part of my argument is anecdotal**: in all of the english classes in my high school, and even in music history classes at undergrad, teachers and professors so readily dismiss and mock the points they think thoreau is making when in reality it's not what he's arguing. Some examples:\n\n'It's just cabin porn''He tells everyone to be self-reliant then has his mom do his laundry'\n\n'He tells everyone that he lived alone in the woods for three years but he didn't'\n\n'He shit talks college despite having a degree from harvard'\n\n'He just wants everyone to give away all their stuff and hoe beans all day'\n\nI could go on, but I think enough people get my point and remember these sorts of dismissive, snide remarks about Thoreau. The reality is: none of these were points Thoreau was trying to make, and the worst part is that the misunderstood points he was making are actually proving to be the root of the problems of today's society. He has a whole freaking chapter dedicated to talking about visitors, his preface tells people quite clearly that his intention wasn't to go three years without human contact (quarantine is showing all of us this would be unreasonable for us to expect of someone anyway), he let his mother do his laundry because they had a loving relationship and she wanted to help him, and you know why he didn't spend all three years in the cabin? Because he felt that it was unjust to hide in the woods while people were still allowed to own slaves. He left to help fugitive slaves in Concord because Thoreau was also a fervent abolitionist.\n\nSo what did Thoreau want? Here are \\*my\\* five biggest take-aways from reading Walden\n\n1. He wanted people to live more simply. He thinks we get too attached to the 'surface' of things and never question what's beneath which leads to materialism and sensationalist news influencing our world to a negative outcome. Sound familiar?\n2. He believed people should spend more time in nature. Not once did he preach that we should all go live like animals forever and eschew society - he argued that people would benefit from living in nature fronting only the bare essentials of life so they may return to society as better, more sensitized people. Living with nature, we see what matters and what's important \\*cough\\* climate change\\* cough\\*\n3. He believed education needed reform and rethinking as its the most important part of a child's development. He believed retreating to nature for truth was the most direct route to de-colonizing and that educating the youth in nature and village rather than schoolhouse and university was the most wholesome way to teach children to think for themselves and be liberated from capitalism\u2019s death-grip on the educational system. Maybe this is why high school teachers tell us all to think he's a quack because of the reality that the educational system has some pretty glaring weaknesses?\n4. He wanted everyone to speak truthfully. \"Rather than love, than money, than fame, give me truth\" he didn't want frivolties - he wanted everyone to only speak with sincerity and from the heart. He didn't want to hear about news from Texas while talking to someone in Concord, he wanted to hear what someone's dreams and ambitions were and he wanted all of us to embody the truth and honesty in life rather than the gilded edges.\n5. He believed the way our economy was set up kept downtrodden people on the bottom without time to better themselves, because if people on the bottom had the time to learn how to better themselves then the whole system would collapse resulting in a better world. Same argument is used today: the bottom percent is unable to get our of the bottom percent, so bad people stay in power and good people stay in submission because they need money to pay bills.\n\nMy point here is not to have everyone drop what they're doing and read Walden or get a Thoreau bust to kiss every morning. My point here is that I really \\*really\\* dislike the way Walden is taught to impressionable youth. I have friends from all over the country who have had similar experiences with Walden in high school, then I get them to read it again in their 20s, and they get similarly frustrated with how their teachers mishandled his book as a way to shit talk breaking away from capitalism and the less-rosy parts of modern life as something for nutjobs.\n\nThe reality is that we need Thoreau's ideas now more than ever. If we had listened to Thoreau, maybe life wouldn't be shit wall-to-wall in America right now. He was against authoritarianism, he was against rampant industrialization for the sake of industrialization (\"If everyone lives a simpler life then who will build the railroads?! \\[paraphrased\\]), he was a firm believer in living with nature, and he was a firm believer that living a simpler, literature and nature- based lifestyle would lead to a healthier society.\n\nYou can think I'm a quack too if you want, but Thoreau was right about almost everything and today we suffer the consequences of decades of high school teachers teaching Walden to our youth without even understanding the point of it. I would like to end with a great quote from Walden.\n\n\u201cI learned this, at least, by my experiment: that if one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours.\u201d\n\nI want you to tell me who needs to hear this more than a room full of teenagers. But please, let's keep telling our youth that Thoreau the abolitionist and environmentalist was full of shit.\n\nThank you for reading if you've made it this far.\n\nFurther reading if you want: [https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/tip-sheet/article/74280-7-reasons-why-henry-david-thoreau-still-matters-today.html](https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/tip-sheet/article/74280-7-reasons-why-henry-david-thoreau-still-matters-today.html)\n\nUpdate: hold your keyboard if you're going to accuse me of generalizing english teachers, you're just gonna make yourself look like a chucklehead. Who should I blame for Walden being mis-taught? The math teachers?\n\nUpdate II Electric Boogaloo: To those thinking I'm making stuff up and this doesn't happen - the thousands of upvotes seem to say otherwise?\n\nUpdate III: The Updatening: I want to thank those of you who have shared your similar experiences to mine. When this post was a wee lad a lot of the earlier comments were rather toxic towards me accusing me of making this up.

Some friends thought it would be fun to see Sting play and tickets are pricey ($94), but it's kind of a bucket list act that I've always wanted to see.  They get added to the cart as $94 + fees per ticket on the ticket selection page, which you would think would come out to be $400 or so at the end for 4 tickets.\n\nExcept when you get to the check out screen next, the tickets are now \"Advance Admission\" tickets and are $194.00 per ticket, + $15.50 service fee, + 4.75 order fee, + shipping because you cannot actually print them at home.  The total is now $842.75 for 4 tickets that when you go to buy them says $94 per ticket + fees.\n\nSo the \"Advance Admission\" must be adding a charge but there is no way to remove it and when you call, you get told the volume of calls is too high for you to talk to an operator so it disconnects.  Each \"Advance Admission\" GA ticket is $194!\n\nSo 4 tickets x $94 = $376\n\nThat means that the fees are $466.75!  This is outrageous.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nEdit: I was able to call in their automated phone system and it worked fine.  However, here is what it looks like online:\n\n[Screenshot one: Me clearly buying them for $94 a piece](https://flic.kr/p/26mBnKu)\n\n[Screenshot two: If you uncheck \"Advance Admission\" the tickets for the Floor suddenly disappear as an option to buy](https://flic.kr/p/2824r8N)\n\n[Screenshot three: What my cart looks like on the next screen](https://flic.kr/p/297nxpt)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nEdit 2: Someone posted that they were able to buy them online without the fee, except at a different venue.  I tried to do that and you can clearly see what the problem is.\n\nAt that venue, it gives you the option to spend an extra $300 to get Early Admission [(Screen shot of that click here)](https://flic.kr/p/LYJN7L)\n\nIf you go to my venue, it says you get Early Admission but the price is quoted as $94 ([Screen shot here](https://flic.kr/p/KssfMR))\n\nSo either my venue is gouging, Ticketmaster is gouging just San Diego people, or Ticketmaster has a very convenient mistake that looks like it would be hard to do by accident.\n\n_________________\n\nEdit 3: so after some very enlightening PMs, it seems like Ticketmaster has fixed this issue. Also, it technically was a mistake this time.  An ex-employee says you have to \"code\" every show which is tedious and the first tier you program is the most expensive one.  It is really easy to omit the later tiers.\n\nHowever, this system therefore always defaults to the most expensive overcharge and they've had this system for years with no material changes.  I hope the programmer for this event isn't punished for Ticketmaster leaving a shitty system in place that defaults to overcharging people because I am a karma whore.  Fix your shit Ticketmaster, there are programmers everywhere nowadays.  Don't make people feel like they have to overpay before the show sells out."}, {"subreddit": "travel", "label": 9, "post": "Went to the Verdon Gorge in France today and kayaked in this gorge-ous water (see what I did there) "}, {"subreddit": "entertainment", "label": 0, "post": "New Mad Max movie starring Chris Hemsworth to be biggest film made in NSW "}, {"subreddit": "technology", "label": 5, "post": "Google Chrome\u2019s next update will finally block autoplay videos that have sound "}, {"subreddit": "sports", "label": 8, "post": "Muhammad Ali dodges 21 punches in 10 seconds.

Here's why. I didn't know quite where else to discuss this, but I needed to get off this my chest and felt this would be a supportive community. In recent months, I have felt increasingly down and depressed due to being closeted indoors, as many of us did due to COVID-19. Days melded together and genuine human connection had become next to impossible as everything went virtual. For an introvert, like myself, I was able to cope with isolation better than most, but I still craved something deep and emotional that I could not easily achieve. This led me down the path to try my first romance novel, specifically a book called ***The Kiss Quotient***, and I fell in love nearly instantly.\n\nLike many men, I have been taught by society that we should generally suppress significant displays of emotion and let actions speak louder than words. This can be seen in nearly every form of media/entertainment focused on male audiences from books, movies, and TV all the way to advertisements.  I would always find myself overwhelmed by the overly masculine protagonists that kicked ass and who's entire character development never centered around their growth with another individual in a romantic nature. Romantic partners were often seen as a plus to have, but never a key component to the growth of the protagonist. For this reason, when a romance took place and offered itself as a core part of the characters growth, it felt refreshing and always made me feel much better as a result (there are so few examples that I can't even think of one off the top of my head even now). Eventually, I realized that there was, in fact, a genre that offered this satisfaction, but not as a side note, as the main purpose of the story: romance.\n\nSimilar to the stigma that men should hide their emotions, I always felt that there was this unsaid truth that romance novels just weren't for men and those who read them often did so privately out of the desire to not be ridiculed or look unmasculine. Similarly, romance novels, at least these days, are thought to simply be erotica which older women can read in public (looking at you ***50 Shades***). These misconceptions has prevented me from trying them for many years as a result, something that I now feel was a missed opportunity for many more years of pleasure reading.\n\nThe book that changed this, as mentioned above, was ***The Kiss Quotient*** by Helen Hoang. This is a story of an autistic woman who hires a male escort to teach her how to be a more romantic person and be more skilled at sex. Naturally, as the story progresses, they learn more about each other and fall in love, despite their difference in social class, wealth, and family trauma. What I loved about the story was not the world, which often led me to other genre's like fantasy, but the characters. While many books focused on male audiences often offer huge casts of characters which have minimal change over the story, this book and many of it's peers had a small cast which gave the writer a chance to highlight their growth on a personal level in greater depth in less time than in huge series such as ***Harry Potter***, where Harry has very little growth in 7 large books (don't get be wrong, I love the series, but I'd hazard a guess that like many others it was due to the interesting world and huge cast of colorful, albeit flat, characters).\n\nI have since devoured several other contemporary romance novels, each time enjoying the emotional character depth present for the two leads. However, the ever present stigmas have prevented me, until now, from really discussing the novels with other people, which as many of you know is half the fun of reading anything. This isolation has made me feel the need to write this post. I feel that there are many others out there that, similar to me, really want something that can provide some emotional based story telling and I believe that romance novels can provide just this.\n\nNow don't get me wrong, these novels do suffer from similar problems in representation regarding men that other genres have towards women. For example, while many TV shows, movies, and books show women as physical goddess that can have the emotional complexity of a hunk of wood, romance novels often depict men as physical machines that have muscles so hard  you could shatter concrete against them while also being gods at sex. This can be very disheartening for male readers, as they can have an inferiority complex and can give the impression that this demigod form is needed to find the emotional happiness depicted in the stories. However, I believe that this provides men a chance to understand and sympathize with the way many women feel about how they are represented in nearly everything else! The solution to improve this stigma in romance novels is the same one needed to fix how women are depicted: more male writers. This in turn can only be done if romance gains a higher male readership who would demand more accurate representation.\n\nIn conclusion, I feel that more male readers should give romantic novels a try. It's my firm belief that similar to me, many would actually find a new medium that can proved emotional satisfaction that is so often left out in other genres despite the fact that romance is something nearly everyone will experience at some point in their life. Further more, it has opened my eyes wider to the pressure that women feel in from other media to accept the idea that your physique is core to your happiness, and understand how degrading it can be.\n\nThank you to everyone that read this entire ramble. I have been needing to get this off my chest for some time and I hope that this gave you some food for thought.\n\n**EDIT:** I really want to thank everyone for all their support and recommendations! It really has meant a lot to see. I have been trying to comment on as many things as I've had time to and I will continue to do so, but please excuse me if I don't get the chance to read what you have to say :(. Also thank your for my first ever gold reward!\n\n**EDIT 2:** At the request of some, I've written a *TLDR*\n\n**TLDR**; Men should try romance novels in spite of social stigma's against displaying emotion as they offer highly satisfying character growth, but also provide a means to experience the inferiority women feel in other genres which can yield much needed shift towards true character representation in all forms of media.\n\n**EDIT 3:** I really want to thank everyone again for their support and suggestions! I just wanted to comment on something that many people have been recommending to me, which is to try watching romance anime and manga. I love romance anime and manga! One reason that I discovered my love of romance in general started when I watch the anime movie **Your Name**. However, as I pointed out to one user, the thing that pushed me towards American romance novels was a significant lack of physical intimacy that is present in Japanese story telling. This is a result of the differences in culture and simply comes with the territory, but as a result, few stories have intimacy present prior to the final chapters or episodes. Also since it was a key topic in my essay, I should also mention that many Japanese anime and manga don't really help with the issues of normal physique in regards to women and can often have some very sexist caricatures of women that I honestly have been getting tired of.

I often read comedy books, Douglas Adams, P.G Wodehouse, Oscar Wilde, Spike Milligan etc. and have always enjoyed them, but rarely do I find myself laughing out loud while reading. *Three Men in a Boat* is in a class of its own where comedy novels are concerned.\n\nWhat surprised me so much was how fresh many of the jokes are for a novel written 128 years ago. There were so many great moments, the hedge maze at Hampton Court, the taxidermy trout in a pub in Streatley, or almost any time Montmorency is mentioned.\n\nI cannot recommend this book enough, but if I go on I'll spoil many of its best parts, so I'll leave you with my favourite passage:\n\n>*It always does seem to me that I am doing more work than I should do. It is not that I object to the work, mind you; I like work; it fascinates me. I can sit and look at it for hours.*\n\n>*I love to keep it by me; the idea of getting rid of it nearly breaks my heart.*\n\n>*You cannot give me too much work; to accumulate work has almost become a passion with me; my study is so full of it now that there is hardly an inch of room for any more. I shall have to throw out a wing soon*\n\n>*And I am careful of my work, too. Why, some of the work that I have by me now has been in my possession for years and years, and there isn't a finger mark on it. I take a great pride in my work; I take it down now and then and dust it. No man keeps his work in a better state of preservation than I do.*\n\nEDIT: Too many replies now for me to answer them all individually. I'm very glad so many of you already know and love the book. If you're looking to read it, as others have pointed out, there is a free version on Kindle and a free audiobook version on Spotify, though apparently the Hugh Laurie version is abridged.\n\nIf it's not your cup of tea, hey that's fine too.

For years I gave up reading. But of course in my busy life it was hard to find time to game. I frequently stayed up till 2 or 3am to play. In the end I realized my current stage of life just does not allow me the luxury to sit down and game for uninterrupted hours at a time. A year-and-a-half ago I picked up a novel for the first time in a very long time. I fell in love with reading again, and have found the portability and flexibility of reading fits my lifestyle so well. You can easily read snatches of a book at a time without needing to devote large tracts of time to it. Plus audio books have been great to fill in commute time and make yard/house work more fun. Lastly, novels provide more satisfying and rich narrative than a lot of games do. One day maybe I'll game again, but I'm glad to rediscover reading.  \n  \nTldr: Books are portable and can be accessed anywhere, unlike my console/gaming pc  \n  \nEdit: A lot of people have asked what book got me back into reading.

I used to LOVE reading when I was younger, even in the early years of high school I would sometimes just go to the library and read during lunch. And then I just stopped. \n\nI always told myself \u201cI\u2019m just too stressed with school\u201d, \u201coh I\u2019m just in a reading slump I\u2019ll come out of it soon\u201d, but I never got back into reading. I would try and try but as we all know, forcing yourself to read is not going to help. And then the diagnosis of depression came and even then, I still put my lack of reading to being stressed and in a slump. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t until yesterday when I was talking to my sister about how I was getting back in to reading again and I was nearly finished my second book in three days. \n\nShe said \u201coh you\u2019re turning into me\u201d. \n\nI wasn\u2019t. She had turned into me, a lover of books and getting lost in the pages. I then realised that it wasn\u2019t a slump. It was my depression that had caused my love for reading to just disappear and I think that is a valuable piece of information I want to share because it has been nearly 5 years since I really sat down and read and read and read, and now that I\u2019m somewhat on the uphill, I\u2019m finding my footing in the reading world again.\n\nEdit: I want to preface that I am not implying that if you have lost your love of reading that you have depression, nor that if you have depression you will lose your love for reading. As a nursing student I know that the signs are different for everyone. I am aware that this is not always a sign of depression for everyone. I just know that if I were back in the darkest spot in my life, seeing a post like this where I can relate to what the OP is saying and feel justified in my feelings, would have positively impacted my journey to where I am. \n\nWe are not all the same in our journeys but we are all the same in our need for justification in the feelings that we may have when in a period of depression. Many people do not feel that what they are experiencing is valid and do not feel like what they are feeling is important. Raising awareness for even the littlest of signs is the least that we can do to push someone to seek the help they need. Justifying their feelings so that they feel that their experience is valid is the most important tool in helping people to get help. \n\nMy goal was to help just one person realise that they are not alone and that losing their love of reading is a valid feeling in the dark times in our life."}, {"subreddit": "entertainment", "label": 0, "post": "Dave Grohl, Pat Smear, Krist Novoselic Periodically Play as Nirvana "}, {"subreddit": "books", "label": 4, "post": "Archive shows medieval nun, Joan of Leeds, faked her own death by crafting a dummy of her body that was buried, to escape the convent and pursue \u2018the way of carnal lust\u2019 "}, {"subreddit": "politics", "label": 7, "post": "Trump walks out of press conference after altercation with female reporters "}, {"subreddit": "gaming", "label": 3, "post": "Anyone else guilty?

I've been reading the comments and it has been very interesting to read both sides of the argument.\n\nFirstly, I would like to agree with those calling me out for overreacting, and accept that my initial accusations against Spotify may have been a bit melodramatic. The \"advert\" is indeed a promotion for a Spotify podcast so they are well within their right to place it within a Spotify curated playlist. I also understand that my title may have insinuated that it was applying to ALL playlists, which does not seem to be the case.\n\nHowever, I still stand by my disapproval of including a track that has no direct relation to the playlist I am listening to on shuffle - as I described in the original post, having a promotion with talking being played among instrumental pieces by Hans Zimmer would definitely be a little distracting, no matter whether it is related to the music genre or not. I feel Spotify could have gone for a less intrusive method to promote their new podcast that didn't involve putting it within a playlist where customers (especially those paying) expect to have a top quality listening experience.\n\nAnd to those who say I can just create my own playlist or use other features to avoid these promotions, I believe that part of the price that I am paying for Premium should include the ability to simply click shuffle on a Spotify curated playlist and expect the best songs produced by that artist, being played at a high-quality, with minimal effort. I shouldn't be expected to go through EVERY song that Hans Zimmer has produced (which is a lot) just to put it in my own personal playlist. For me, Spotify has always been about ease of access to music.\n\nEdit 2: Just had another look at the playlist and the promotion track has gone! Wow, I wonder if this post had anything to do with it...\n\n[Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/6ZKBwDW.png)"}, {"subreddit": "travel", "label": 9, "post": "The Great Wall allllll to myself!

Sometimes it takes an hour or so for the code to become active just after I create it, so if it doesn't work, go ahead and try again a while later. I'll change it to COPSHOTMEINPORTLAND2 on the 4th.\n\nUdemy has changed their coupon policies, and I'm now only allowed to make 3 coupon codes each month with several restrictions. Hence why each code only lasts 3 days. **I won't be able to make codes after this period**, but I will be making free codes next month.

Signing up gives you lifetime access so you can work on it at your own pace.\n* This Udemy course covers roughly the same content as the 1st edition book (the book has a little bit more, but all the basics are covered in the online course), which you can read for free online at https://inventwithpython.com\n* The 2nd edition of Automate the Boring Stuff with Python is now available online: https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/\n* I do plan on updating the Udemy course for the second edition, but it'll take a while because I have other book projects I'm working on. Expect that update to happen in mid- or late-2020. If you sign up for this Udemy course, you'll get the updated content automatically once I finish it. It won't be a separate course.\n* It's totally fine to start on the first edition and then read the second edition later. I'll be writing a blog post to guide first edition readers to the parts of the second edition they should read.\n* I wrote a blog post to cover [what's new in the second edition](https://inventwithpython.com/blog/2019/10/07/whats-new-in-the-2nd-edition-of-automate-the-boring-stuff-with-python/)\n* **You're not too old to learn to code.

My son is turning into an avid reader, but he still likes to hear me read to him before bed. I've been using that as an opportunity to introduce him to some of my favorite books. He's already read Harry Potter and the Percy Jackson series himself. Together we read *The Hobbit* and *The Lord of the Rings*. It took some time reading it a chapter a night, but we both enjoyed it.\n\nSo...at the used book store, I picked up a book I remembered reading when I was much younger...*The Source of Magic* by Piers Anthony. (Yep, some of you are probably already knowing where this is going.) My rose-colored memories of Xanth remember the silly puns and personal quests of the protagonists. What I didn't recall so much was the blatant misogyny. Anthony seems to hate women, if the regular insults to their character, intelligence and worth are any measure. I've had to tell my son several times that I find any reference to women in the books to be awful. I'm trying to use it as a teaching experience...but it has soured some of my remembrances, and it makes me wonder how terrible some of the other stories I read in the 70's and 80's were. (I'm not reading a 10-year-old Heinlein, so don't worry about that.)\n\nI guess the moral is that sharing something you love with your kids can sometimes make you realize that your memories tend to be filtered by your understanding at the time. I think I need to be a bit more cautious in the future.\n\nUPDATE:  Wow...I disappeared into a meeting for 7 hours (don't ask), and came out to find this explosion. So...\n\n1) Thank you very much to everybody who has recommended alternates. Pratchett and McCaffrey are two that I'm seriously considering...and I'm going to look into some of the authors I haven't read to see if they're a) appropriate and b) stuff that I would enjoy. Thanks to the person who gave me a silver, too.\n\n2) My primary issue with Robert Heinlein is how some of his works are a little TOO into the whole free love agenda, and what I perceived as some really racist aspects of his writing. Some folks here have convinced me that the latter may just be really inept attempts to address the topic. Still not planning on talking twincest with my kid.\n\n3) My son is mature enough to not take to heart sexism or racism in reading. It was more embarrassing to me to realize that something I enjoyed and even recommended was so obviously against my personal feelings as an adult.

Note, this is all happening in the thick of an intense battle with men fighting all around:\n\n>Paris drew back his arm from the bow  \nand shot. Not in vain did the arrow fly from his hand,  \nbut hit Diomedes' right foot, on the flat part: the shaft went through,  \nstuck fast in the ground. Then, with loud laughter, Paris  \nsprang out from his hiding place and shouted boastfully:  \n\"You're hit! Not in vain did my shaft fly! Oh, how I wish  \nI'd caught your nether belly, and taken your life away!  \nThen would the Trojans have had some relief from their troubles,  \nwho now tremble before you like bleating sheep with a lion.\"\n\n>To him, quite unafraid, strong Diomedes replied:  \n\"Bowman, foul-mouthed cursor, pretty-locks, ogler of virgins! --  \nIf you'd only make trial of me face to face, wearing armor,  \nthen your bow and your showers of arrows would not protect you;  \nand even now your boast is just to have scratched my foot!  \nI don't care -- it could well have been a daft child or a woman  \nthat shot me, so blunt the shafts of a weakling, a nobody!  \nVery different indeed, if it only grazes its target,  \nis the sharp spear sped by *my* hand: it brings a man instant death,  \nand the cheeks of his widow are torn in death and mourning,  \nand his children are orphaned, while he reddens the earth  \nwith his blood, and rots, more vultures than women round him.\"\n\nI think it's the fact that Paris basically pinned Diomedes in place with an arrow through the foot, creating the perfect opportunity to take him out while he's hindered, but instead opts to stand out of arms reach and boast about hitting him, that makes this passage so funny to me. I guess that's a part of Paris' character: He's got a loud mouth but not enough courage to take on Diomedes, even in this weakened state.\n\nI would love to see a parody of The Iliad that captures this; all the soldiers around them pausing the fight to let them duke it out verbally, ooooooo-ing at some of the biggest burns."}, {"subreddit": "python", "label": 1, "post": "Developers whose first programming language was Python, what were the challenges you encountered when learning a new programming language?

Does anyone agree? Hello,\n\nI\u2019ve been posting on r/books for a few years now, and while I have enjoyed a lot of the interactions and discussions I\u2019ve had, there\u2019s something about the sub that is really starting to bug me. Maybe some of you feel the same.\n\nI was reading a post yesterday, where the OP (16 years old) was asking for recommendations about more \u2018mature\u2019 books. He enjoyed reading YA and stuff, but wondered what else was out there. When someone asked him why he would want to do this, OP said something along the lines of he felt \u2018ashamed\u2019 to still be reading these kinds of books.\n\nSomeone downvoted him for it. Similarly, looking down the thread I could see that many people who had offered recommendations about mature books had been down voted. I then started thinking about threads that I have commented on. There has been so many times where I have tried to contribute thoughtfully to a discussion \u2013 just like the 16 year old OP - but because others didn\u2019t agree, I\u2019ve been downvoted.\n\nI can\u2019t be the only person to have noticed this trend, and it\u2019s a bummer. r/books is a place where we *discuss* and share opinions about the thing we love most of all \u2013 books. It should be a place where we can get inspiration and, hopefully, learn about writers that ordinarily would have passed us by. But instead, I feel like there are a lot of people here that treat the place as a zero-sum game, where they are \u2018right\u2019 and you are \u2018wrong\u2019 \u2013 and downvote accordingly. *You don\u2019t like my favourite book?* - Downvote. *You explain why in a thoughtful, polite manner that encourages further discussion?* - Fuck you. Downvote. The more this trend continues, the more the sub declines until all that\u2019s left are people jealously guarding their opinions, unable to hear those of others over the roar of their internal rage.\n\nI mean, I try and my bit to combat this. I don\u2019t downvote other people\u2019s opinions, even if they are very different from my own, and I do this because that\u2019s not what the function is for. The sidebar: *It is our intent and purpose to foster and encourage in-depth discussion [\u2026] in a safe, supportive environment.* I save the downvotes for people who break these rules - the trolls and dickheads spewing racism.\n\nWhich isn\u2019t to say I\u2019m perfect \u2013 I\u2019ve got into some heated arguments on here and said some stuff I\u2019ve regretted, but in those instances I\u2019ve tried to apologise because after I\u2019d calmed down, I realised that while we all have different personal tastes \u2013 they are just that: personal tastes. They are not objective. In the same way, r/books frustrates me sometimes in how it\u2019s focused on the same books (Hitchhikers, TLoTR, Pratchett, Gaiman etc.), but I don\u2019t downvote these threads or the people commenting on them, because this is a place where people should be allowed to discuss their passions without getting blue-arrowed. \n\nThe world is full of people screaming at each other with their fingers in their ears. r/books doesn\u2019t have to become another such place.\n\nI have a feeling I\u2019m opening myself up to a world of hurt with this post, but fuck it \u2013 I care about the sub, and want to see it thrive. \n"}, {"subreddit": "politics", "label": 7, "post": "The Republicans who were once so pro-life they fought over one woman on life support now want to sacrifice grandma for the economy "}, {"subreddit": "music", "label": 6, "post": "TIL about a website called Boil the Frog - put in two artists of different genres and you'll get a Spotify playlist that gradually and seamlessly takes you from point A to point B.

Here's a list of my goals for this year, which is similar to last year.\n\nOne of my main objective for this year to learn to get consistent, for which I want work towards my goals everyday, and not in bursts.\n\nSome of my goals for this year along with their daily targets are:\n\n- To learn French good enough to read and speak with a bit of fluency by the end of the year. For that I am practicing it daily.\n\n- Practice piano every day for at least an hour. Currently I am learning Claire de Lune, so, just want to finish learning it. Then record it and a piece by Chopin as soon as possible. As of now I haven't set my final goals for this year, just want to keep practicing.\n\n- Read 60 to 70 novels by the end of the year for which I read a novel for at least an hour daily.\n\n- Workout daily\n\n#### Edit 4:\n\nMany people seem to get an idea from my (bit misleading, which I can't edit now) title that I am now cured of depression. Which I already clarified in the post. To be clear, I still get depressed. But I have just found a way to not let it paralyze me like it used to earlier. I kept myself busy for the same reason.

I mean, I don\u2019t prescribe to Ayn Rand\u2019s world views, but that\u2019s not the reason I don\u2019t like it. In fact, I often really enjoy alternative perspectives in writing. It\u2019s just that she\u2019s so blunt about it. I dunno - maybe that\u2019s the reason a lot of people like it! I just find it so unsatisfying to read two or three times a page about how great monopolies are and how much government sucks.\n\nIf you want me to believe what you\u2019re writing, you have to sell it to me. What makes George Orwell so great is his ability to clearly state a message, yet also thinly veil it in symbolism and metaphor. It makes it feel genuine, not forced. Ray Bradbury does the same thing with \u201cFahrenheit 451\u201d. The world feels natural, as does the message.\n\nFor \u201cAtlas Shrugged\u201d, though, it\u2019s just not. The line between good and bad is so black-and-white it\u2019s cliche, and not in a clever way either.  All the characters speak in the same way too. They literally sound like they\u2019re all the same person. Furthermore, it\u2019s not just that the characters sound the same; all the protagonists practically have the same features!\n\nI\u2019m going to describe a character, and you\u2019re going to have to tell me which one it is: They\u2019re gaunt, have steely blue eyes, and a cold demeanor. Who is it? You can\u2019t tell me, can you. THEYRE ALL THE SAME. \n\nIt\u2019s really frustrating because people kept telling me how good this book was going to be. I usually love political-fiction. It\u2019s my favorite genre, in fact. So why is this so terrible? I mean, I\u2019ve kept reading because it\u2019s so bad it\u2019s almost kind of good, but then it just keeps going back to bad.

My friend told me about PyGame, and I decided to try to write an entire game in it.  I want to tell you the order I did things in, as I think you might find it interesting, and maybe try it yourself some time!\n\n**Background:**\n\nEpikos is an RPG I'd been wanting to make for years, but never really had the time to make.  Python, however, writes really expressive code and can really accelerate dev time.  I feel like I can write code 50X faster in Python than in C++.\n\nSince I have a day job, this had to be a project which I could do after work.  Entire thing took about two years, including making all the assets for the game and all the tools.  Workload was about 2 hours after work each day, and a lot more time on the weekends.\n\n**Step 1:  Making the tools for the game**\n\nFor reference, game screenshots can be seen here:\n\nhttp://www.epikosrpg.com/screenshots/\n\n**The Console:**\n\nFirst, I made what I call a \"console.\"  It's a bit like a DOS or Linux shell.  I wanted this so I could type commands into my game and the toolset used to create the game.  It doesn't look like much, but here is an example of what the console looks like:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/mMutYwL\n\n**The Paint Program:**\n\nNext, the game needed a program to create sprite art in.  I could have used photoshop, aesprite, or any number of paint programs, but I wanted to make my own custom sprite animation tool, and I wanted it in Python.  I had barely done any python coding at this point, but even then the paint tool took only a couple of days to write.  It's called tilemake, and it looks like this:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/Qw4BMMc\n\nAs you can see, this paint tool uses the console, which I had built first.  In the above example, I have loaded the \"knight\" sprite, which is used for one of the main characters in the game.  The tool shows you multiple zoomed in versions of the sprite (\"mips\") and you can paint on any one of them, using the CGA color palette.  You can also animate the sprites in this very tool.\n\nI got a lot of milage out of this tool, as the game has 826 sprite frames in it, all made with this very paint program.\n\n**The Map Editor:**\n\nNow, my game needed 2D maps.  Since I had some art made with the paint program, it was time to arrange this art in the form of a map.  The map editor looks like this:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/qLA9vYk\n\nThere are several components to this editor, but keep in mind I'm sticking 100% to Python.  In the main view, you can zoom and scroll about with the mouse, and paint using several different sized brushes.\n\nYou can see a column to the right which says \"natural\".  This shows all the sprites which are used in a natural environment.  There are other categories, such as indoors, dungeon, etc.  Categories were important, since I have many, many different sprites.\n\nFinally, on the bottom you can see our old friend, the console.\n\n**Step 2:  The Game Itself:**\n\nOnce you have the map editor, making a game isn't really that different, it just has gameplay logic.  Most of it is really simple, this includes combat logic, movement, etc.  I'm not going to go into the details of these since writing them in Python should be fairly trivial, but ask me if you want something explained in greater detail.  I will, however, go over some highlights and gotchas:\n\n**AStar (A*):**\n\nA* is a common AI algorithm used for pathing.  Implementing it in Python is pretty easy.  Python reads a lot like pseudocode, and A* can be found on wikipedia:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm\n\nThat code isn't really very different from Python is it?  As an excercise, you can try pasting that into Python and see what you need to change.  Hint:  not much.  Shouldn't take you more than half an hour to get some good AI pathing going.\n\n**Save/Load with Pickle:**\n\nI *love* pickle, and used it for save/loading.  It's a standard Python module, so if you haven't used it yet you should check it out.  One gotcha was that saveing and loading maps was too expensive in pickle, so I compressed the maps first with basic dictionary encoding, and then used pickle on them.\n\nWhen writing save/load, make sure to include version filtering or some mechanism so that if you change file formats later on, older files are automatically updated.  You don't want your players to lose progress just because you patched and changed savegame format!\n\n**Font?:**\n\nThere are several legal issues surrounding the use of fonts on a cross-platform title, and I really didn't want to bother with that.  I couldn't find a good free font which matched my art style, so I created my own font for my game.  If you can do this, I recommend it, because then you own it and can use it forever.\n\n**Music:**\n\nOne thing I didn't write from scratch was the music authoring software.  Audio isn't really my expertise, but I wanted NES sounding music.  I ended up using this:\n\nhttp://famitracker.com/\n\nFamitracker is a fun way to write NES-sounding music, and indeed it actually writes to the nes file format.  Of course, PyGame can't play this, so I converted it to .ogg format.  Why .ogg?  I found that other supported formats tended to crash pygame, so I recommend that one.\n\n**Sound FX:**\n\nSimilarly, I wanted an old-school feeling for my sound FX.  Authoring these in famitracker didn't seem that efficient, but someone showed me a tool called bfxr:\n\nhttp://www.bfxr.net/\n\nThis let me create all kinds of sounds for my game.  For more complicated sounds, I needed to fallback to famitracker, but 90% of the sounds were in bfxr.\n\n**Shipping the Game:**\n\nI couldn't ship raw .py files, so I used pyinstaller to turn my game into a single .exe file.  I had tried python2exe, but couldn't get it to work very well with pygame.  Maybe you can have better luck with python2exe, but I'd recommend pyinstaller.  PyInstaller uses another library called setupTools.  For some reason, my .exe wouldn't work with the latest version of setupTools (gave an error and immediately quit), so I had to do this:\n\npip install setuptools==19.2\n\nThat gives you the older version, which should work.\n\nThe last part of shipping is making the .exe and game assets into an installer.  For this I used something called NSIS.  Sadly, I can't recommend you use this at this point, since it was on Sourceforge and if you go there now you'll probably get viruses and malware (RIP Sourceforge).  If you happen to have an older version of NSIS, I recommend backing it up on your google drive, since re-downloading it is not an option.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile there were some gotchas, I didn't have too much trouble making a small-scale game 100% in Python, and it was a suitable project to do after work, even while working a full-time job.  \n\nHappy coding!\n\n**Edit:**\n\nThank you for the Reddit gold.  This has inspired me to share some other misc info with you now:\n\n*  One huge advantage of Python is that porting from Windows to Linux only took an afternoon.  I did it all on virtualbox running Mint.  In fact, setting up virtualbox to run Mint was harder than porting the game.  There were two gotchas.  First, if you're using time.clock() on windows, make sure to change it to time.time() on Linux.  Second, some of the backslashes in filenames needed to be changed to forward slashes.  That's it!!!\n\n*  If you are on Windows, I recommend trying the Python plug-in for Visual Studio.  I didn't actually use it while developing my game, but I think it would have helped from time to time.  It gives breakpoints, variable watch, and callstack info.\n\n\n\n"}, {"subreddit": "science", "label": 2, "post": "Physicist Stephen Hawking dies aged 76 We regret to hear that [Stephen Hawking died tonight at the age of 76]( http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-43396008)\n\nWe are creating a megathread for discussion of this topic here.

Happy Monday. If you're in America I hope you're enjoying the holiday :)\n\nThis post is a follow-up to **[my original post from a while back](http://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/282bug/i_spend_my_free_time_developing_a_new_way_to/)**. I've been hard at work and wanted to give you all an update on where the project is at. So, after checking in with the mods and getting a thumbs-up, I decided it was time to make a post!\n\nI've been developing a YouTube music player for almost three years. It's called **[Streamus](https://streamus.com)**. It is one of the most [well-received extensions in the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/streamus/jbnkffmindojffecdhbbmekbmkkfpmjd/reviews). The software is free, the code is [open-source](https://github.com/MeoMix/StreamusChromeExtension/), I have no interest in your personal data, and you already have an account if you're signed into Chrome. \n\n* Here are some screenshots of the new design: **http://imgur.com/a/vyd56**\n* **[Here's a short, silent video of me using Streamus.](https://streamus.com/demo.html)**\n\nTrue to my word in the first post, I quit my job to focus on Streamus full-time in July of last year. I do some contract work for a handful of hours each week to pay rent and buy food, but, other than that, I'm living on savings and focused on the project. Streamus does not make me any money. I actually lose a bit each month running the server. But... if you're into music for the money then you're in it for the wrong reasons. :)\n\nNever heard of Streamus before? Here's a short list of features I commonly use:\n\n* **[Keyboard Shortcuts](http://i.imgur.com/twhiwrH.png)** - Shortcuts can work with Chrome focused or globally. No more having to alt+tab to mute a song. Media keys work, too. \n* **[Radio](http://i.imgur.com/qaulh2M.png)** - Streamus offers something similar to Pandora/Spotify Radio. It is fueled by YouTube's \"Related Songs,\" but with a bit more logic on top to improve the results.\n* **[Context Menus](http://i.imgur.com/CNmfnxj.png)** - Ever see a song mentioned without an accompanying URL? Just highlight the text, right-click, and play it. [Also supports right-clicking on YouTube URLs.](http://i.imgur.com/HL1CbrB.png)\n* **[Omnibox](http://i.imgur.com/QhtjS3N.png)** - If you know the name of a song you want and don't need all the UI fluff then why not just use your URL bar?\n\nSo, that's me. How about you? What do you like and dislike about the service? What would you like to see more of in the future?\n\nLooking forward to talking! Thanks for taking the time to read. \n\nOh! And before I go, want some music? Here, have a playlist of some songs I'm currently jamming to: \n\n* https://share.streamus.com/playlist/f4ff11345c27/tropical_house_trap. \n\nI'm big into EDM. So, this playlist consists of tropical house and trap. Enjoy!\n\nBy popular request, here's some more of the music I enjoy:\n\n* https://share.streamus.com/playlist/1e70d6e843da/meos_music\n\n**Frequently Asked Questions:**\n\n* **All I see is white / Streamus doesn't work**: Update your version of Google Chrome. Streamus requires v37 minimum, current is v39.\n\n* **Firefox Support**: When I last investigated Streamus for Firefox I found that while FF's extension ecosystem is great, they don't appear to support the same \"Window Overlay\" as Chrome. This makes the general implementation of Streamus pretty difficult. If another developer is privvy to something I'm not, feel free to let me know, but, as it stands, waiting on FF to support Streamus rather than the other way around. \n\n* **Opera**: https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/streamustm-beta/\n\n* **Last.FM**: [It's on my TODO list.](https://github.com/MeoMix/StreamusChromeExtension/issues/116)\n\n* **SoundCloud**: [It's on my TODO list](https://github.com/MeoMix/StreamusChromeExtension/issues/4) and [I've broken ground in coding it](https://github.com/MeoMix/StreamusChromeExtension/blob/Development/src/js/background/model/soundCloudAPI.js)\n\n* **Importing and Auto-Updating Playlists**: You can import playlists through the [Create Playlist](http://i.imgur.com/cw8TdTl.png) dialog. Playlists are currently static representations and do not auto-update when changes are made on YouTube, but [it's on my TODO list](https://github.com/MeoMix/StreamusChromeExtension/issues/16)\n\n* **Mobile**: No real plans for mobile currently. All the most popular YouTube music apps suddenly went missing from the app stores in December after YouTube updated their app to support background playback. I'd like to see how all that pans out before putting any effort into that space. Sorry, I know it's frequently requested. \n\n* **Updates / Change Log**: Come on over to **[r/streamus](http://www.reddit.com/r/streamus)** :)"}, {"subreddit": "politics", "label": 7, "post": "JPMorgan stops donations to GOP lawmakers who voted to overturn election "}, {"subreddit": "music", "label": 6, "post": "DMX Family Visits, Holds Out Hope As He Remains on Life Support After OD "}, {"subreddit": "travel", "label": 9, "post": "Riding on top of the world\u2019s longest train for 12 hours through Mauritania "}, {"subreddit": "technology", "label": 5, "post": "The Average U.S. Millennial Watches More Netflix Than TV "}, {"subreddit": "politics", "label": 7, "post": "Biden approves $230m for Covid home test kits that take 15 minutes and are 95% accurate "}, {"subreddit": "sports", "label": 8, "post": "Japan score a brilliant team try against Scotland in the Rugby World Cup!

However, the way that I've seen \"reading more\" being discussed, especially on the internet is...just not good. The advice that people give on \"how to read more\" is almost always terrible, such as speed \"reading\", audiobooks, skimming etc. And these are fine methods when, say, you have to go through a textbook for a test and you don't have enough time, but for reading in general, as an activity, it's just bad.\n\nIt's almost as if reading has become an intellectual status symbol in the society, and the more books you read, the smarter you are perceived to be. So the end goal is to just read as many books as you can, without regard to the enjoyment and the actual reading experience.\n\nYou'd never find a cinephile saying \"Yeah, I generally skip over some parts of film to get to the meat and like read the Wikipedia summary to help, that's just so that I can watch as many films as possible.\"\n\nPeople forget that at the end of the day, reading is a consumptive activity. Can it, in general, be more demanding than other consumptive activities like watching films and listening to music? Yes, absolutely. But it's still a consumptive activity, so applying the kind of strategy that one applies for doing productive work -- like how to study more, how to work more, how to practice more (an instrument, for example) is not good, in my opinion.\n\nThe best experience is to go through a book slowly. Read each and every line, and let it settle in your mind. If you like a sentence/para, or if you don't fully understand it read it twice, thrice. It's better to closely read one book per year than to skim over a hundred.\n\nWhat do y'all think?\n\nEDIT: With respect to my point about audiobooks (including some of the comments), I apologise. I realise I have been insensitive towards certain groups, and that I need to educate myself better on their experiences, the problems they face and evaluate my own privilege.

It turns out that I never hated it, I just wasn't reading the right books. \n\nSome time last week, I saw a post on the front page from this subreddit talking about the book, \"When Breath Becomes Air\", and how it was the first story that made someone cry in 15 years. I didn't believe you could actually be touched by books; the stories I was forced to read in school never made me feel that way and I assumed all books were the same.\n\nBefore I even clicked on the post, I checked it out at the library to see what it was all about, and I finished it in two days. I was bawling my eyes out by the end of the book and since then I've been hooked.\n\nI found out I loved reading on my own, at my own pace, peacefully in my room. Sitting in an overcrowded classroom full of kids who didn't want to be there, reading 20 pages a day, and having to stop in the middle of a chapter just to answer questions about the character is the reason why kids think they hate reading. And it doesn't help at all that teachers pick the slowest readers to read the longest paragraphs in the book. \n\nI looked up must-read books on Google and this subreddit came up, giving me a whole list of books that people recommended. I went to the library on Sunday and picked up 4 more books that were on the list. Today I finished reading The Alchemist, and tomorrow I will read Brave New World. \n\nI never thought I'd ever enjoy reading on my own time, but now I can see why people love books so much.

It  took around 3 months of programming, and is 5k+ lines and uses Python and Cython. The library is also very well maintained (just had my first issue yesterday - thanks u/ForceBru!)\n\nYou can install this library with pip. It's on PyPI : [https://pypi.org/project/sealion/](https://pypi.org/project/sealion/) and GitHub : [SeaLion Repo](https://github.com/anish-lakkapragada/SeaLion)\n\nA problem I saw with the current ml libraries and tutorials was that they didn't go over too much into the theory of these libraries - more so on just the syntax and calling the functions. In the summer of 2020 I could easily build a CNN or RNN in tensorflow, but I didn't understand it - hence I decided to start learning from scratch. It has been quite a ride and I needed a lot of help along the way to help me understand the math (I've never taken a calculus class) but it has been tremendously useful in helping me understand every aspect of ML from the code, theory, and the speed.\n\n**SeaLion is an extremely comprehensive library that spans from basic Linear Regression up to modern approaches like deep neural networks. It mostly deals with regression, unsupervised clustering, bayesian models, dimensionality reduction, neural networks, etc. If you've never heard some of those algorithms before (or just are a complete beginner to ML), you are in the right place!! SeaLion has plenty of code examples to help guide you through each step of the way!**\n\nThe examples go over not just how sealion's code can be called but the intuition on how they work. They compare and contrast the benefits and cons of KMeans vs. DBSCAN or PCA vs. tSNE and go over each function in a easy-to-understand way. SeaLion is extremely easy to use, and the API function names and classes are similar to those of other ml libraries to make it easier for those experienced to grasp the syntax. Of course none of the actual source code uses any ml frameworks.\n\nYou can find the code examples here : [SeaLion Repo](https://github.com/anish-lakkapragada/SeaLion)\n\nIf you would like to install, please make sure you are on version 4.0.1 and have Python 3.\n\nI think you'll greatly enjoy SeaLion, especially if you are just getting started. Please give the repo a star! And to all my other coders, regardless of your age : keep pushing!!\n\n**EDIT : thank you all so much for your appreciation and comments!** I put this in the evening and just got one comment for a few hours and I thought it was done -  so I barely even remembered about it in the morning. It's so nice to start a Monday with comments and support from so many people.\n\nSeaLion was built for fun and I'm super surprised that it got this big! I only put it on GitHub to share code with some friends, but this is great! This is only possible due to people who make stack overflow posts, reddit posts (thank you!), YouTube videos, etc. that make everything extremely clear.
